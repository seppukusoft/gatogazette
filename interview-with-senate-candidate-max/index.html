I am running for senate. I do not believe the current senators are doing a good job, nor do I believe they have been completely transparent, honest, or well-intentioned with their actions. I’ll promise you this—I’ll never tell you a lie, not in my campaign, nor my Senate tenure if I may be blessed with one. That is the biggest issue, trust. I think it’s time to turn a new page, away from scandal, That is why I’m running to be your senator.<br><br><b>What would you say is your flagship policy?</b><br><br>I would say a bicameral legislature would be one of my MOST important policy plans[.]<br><br><b>What is your plan to implement a bicameral legislature? How would each house be set up and what would their powers be?</b><br><br>I believe the senate size should be reduced so that there is more of a use to a lower house. Additionally, 19 senators (which are how many are accepted currently) are way too much, even factoring in the fact 32 or so candidates are running (more than half!). The proposition for a lower amount, which was made by a member whose name I will not speak, comes off to me as very acceptable. As for the lower chamber, I’m thinking something like the “House of Delegates” to give a member of that lower house a proper name. Furthermore, I believe this HoD should have at least 4-7 members, following a similar formula to the senate. I strongly believe in a lower chamber because they can provide checks and balances to the senate, which can come in handy when the Executive branch cannot or will not. Also, I would like to mention that I agree with fellow candidate Lucas that a lower house would allow for more representation.<br><br><b>A recent poll showed that the issues that the voters cared most about when choosing a candidate to support were (in order) "improving the economy/increasing its use," "senate expansion," and "increasing government efficiency."<br>First, how do you square your support for a bicameral legislature with the popular demand for simply expanding the Senate?<br>Second, what are your positions on the other two issues?</b><br><br>First off, if I may combine two issues. A bicameral legislature would actually streamline the government, by blocking some of the more extreme bills the current Senate would paas, and some of the more extreme bills the lower chamber may pass. If anything, it’d allow for a better, faster way for bills to be signed without having to worry about specific contents of the bill. Furthermore, a second legislature would stop a group of senators to just vote the same way to pass the laws they want, and would make the Congress (referring to both this hypothetical lower house and senate) be in line with public interest[.]<br>Second off, the economys[sic] a very, very tricky thing to handle. To increase productivity, I would like to suggest some sort of commodities/goods system in which one can spend their money. However, the specifics of this I do not know, and no one else seems to have come up with anything, except Biscuit, who suggested this. I would say I am inclined to support this considering we have no other use for our money anyways.<br>As for government efficiency, I am a huge proponent of streamlining the executive branch, and I am an opponent for bureaucratic measures like Executive Senators, which demonstrates an unfair breachment of the seperation of the Legislative and Executive branches. President Imade’s actions to streamline the departments have been amazing and I commend them for their work on the executive branch, and hope to see more. Targeted knockouts and removals of certain branches, channels are imperative for a server thats easy to navigate. I remember when I first joined and couldn’t understand a thing, so I went straight to general.<br><br><b>Are there any other views or policies you want the public to know about?</b><br><br>I would like the public to know that we do not have to live like this, with this senate. The senate has taken our trust and thrown it out of the window, making provate deals without the public’s interest taken into account. I will be a different Senator, and I promise to never lie during my campaign and tenure[.]<br><br><b>Finally, if you could summarize your campaign in a single word, what would it be?</b><br><br>Trust.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 25, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://gatogazette.com/tags/election/">Election</a></li><li><a href="https://gatogazette.com/tags/interview/">Interview</a></li><li><a href="https://gatogazette.com/tags/politics/">Politics</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://gatogazette.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><img src="https://gatogazette.com/media/website/413ef4d72f3c629d67aa92a8a2f02963.png" loading="lazy" height="496" width="496" class="bio__avatar" alt=""><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://gatogazette.com/authors/test/" rel="author">Gato</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Writer and editor covering politics, law, and polling.</p></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://gatogazette.com/short-report-amendment-referendum-exit-poll/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Short Report: Amendment Referendum Exit Poll</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://gatogazette.com/opinion-do-not-let-halfcats-plea-fall-on-deaf-ears/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Opinion: Do Not Let Halfcat&#x27;s Plea Fall On Deaf Ears</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__comments"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="comments"><div class="comments-wrapper"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="commento"></div><noscript>Please enable JS to use the comments form.</noscript><script type="text/javascript">var commento_element_to_check = document.getElementById('commento');
