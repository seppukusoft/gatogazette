This periodical will analyze recent approval polls of government officials and/or offices and attempt to explain the statistics! In this edition of Approval Ratings: Explained, we will cover the approval poll of the 134th Senate.&nbsp;</p><h4 id="lessugreaterthe-incumbent-reportlessugreater"><u>The Incumbent Report</u></h4><div><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/21576492"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21576492/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" data-is-external-image="true"></noscript></div></div><p>As you can see from the above graph, most of the senators from the 133rd Senate trended toward the middle of the pack after their initial approval polls. This mid-migration trend caught nearly every senator except for three: Stalin, Eleanor, and Kelvin. These three Senators ended up running as incumbents for the 134th Senate and retained their seats – some in a more straightforward manner than others.<br></p><p>The only other two incumbent senators who were re-elected are Ppatpat and MyPenJustBroke. These two’s approval trends followed the pack of the other ten senators, as we believe that the Senators exited the honeymoon period – which is colloquially defined as the short period of heightened approval ratings experienced by a person in the beginning periods of their tenure.</p><p>It should be noted, though, that while these two Senators did follow the mid-maxxing approval trend, both MyPen and Ppatpat had the most #1 votes of all of the incumbent senators. This suggests that both senators have strong intra-party and inter-party support, allowing them to continue their legislative work.&nbsp;<br></p><h4 id="lessugreaterthe-senators-a-mixed-analysislessugreater"><u>The Senators (A Mixed Analysis)</u></h4><p>After the CTSA drama ousted former PUP member zhennyzhenzhen, among others, and brought in FLY GUY, Thyme, and Kelvin, we have been able to conduct an approval poll and report our results here. In addition to reporting the raw “Net Approval” statistic, we will also provide you with our analysis as to why we believe each Senator has achieved their approval level.<br></p><p>A note for the reader before we get started: Senator FLY GUY’s switch from an independent candidate to the New People’s Party after the 134th Senate Election left many asking where he should be sorted. So, as an amazing example of compromise in the democratic process, I unilaterally decided to include charts and rankings that outline the bill proposals which account for FLY GUY being both an Independent and an NPP Senator.&nbsp;</p><div><hr class="separator separator--dots"><center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center><br><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="" alt="" class="ad" data-is-external-image="true"><hr class="separator separator--dots"></div><h6 id="sen-mypenjustbroke-npp-735-net-approval">Sen. MyPenJustBroke (NPP) – 73.5% Net Approval</h6><p>Senator MyPenJustBroke (or “MyPen”) is the Chief Policy Director of the New People’s Party, and he is one of two senators from the NPP in the 134th Senate – one of three if you count Senator FLY GUY. Senator MyPen was elected for the second time with the most first-place votes, amounting to 13 votes. Senator MyPen has the highest approval rating for both 133rd Senate incumbents and for the 134th Senate.</p><p>One of the most striking aspects of Senator MyPen’s tenure is his volume of legislative output. He has introduced four bills this session, accounting for 30.8% of all proposed legislation. His proposals cover a wide range of issues, demonstrating a strategic appeal to different voter bases. Voters tend to gravitate toward candidates who are effective policymakers, and MyPen’s productivity and legislative ambition make him stand out as someone who is not just present but actively shaping the direction of governance.</p><p>MyPen’s policy initiatives are not overtly partisan - they often address both economic fairness and governmental efficiency. His popularity appears to stem from an innate ability to appeal across party lines by addressing issues and being the one to form consensus on solutions. He has a high volume of legislation and debate, but doesn’t alienate moderate or conservative voters while doing so.&nbsp;<br></p><h6 id="sen-ppatpat-c-698-net-approvallessbrgreater">Sen. Ppatpat (C) – 69.8% Net Approval<br></h6><p>Senator Ppatpat (or “Pat”) is the leader of the Centre, and the only senator from the Centre in the 134th Senate. The Centre delegate held the third-most first-place votes in the 134th Senate Election, with seven under his belt. Immediately after his election, he campaigned and won the 134th Speaker election. Speaker Pat was undoubtedly thrown into interesting times in the first few days of his speakership.</p><p>For one, he was forced to invalidate all nominations and legislative votes after the DoJ’s use of the CTSA forced the Senate into limbo. After the final certification of the votes pulled four senator-hopefuls out of the 134th and brought three (mostly) fresh faces in, Speaker Pat reintroduced the votes and expediently went about Senate business. Most recently, Speaker Pat facilitated the Senate’s passage of the current State of Caution, enacted in response to the PUP’s recent threats and incursions against SimDemocracy private party and organizational servers.</p><p>Speaker Pat’s introduced bills follow a steady rhythm – both the Eminent Domain Act of 2025 and the Platform Accessibility Act (Amendment) are aimed at forming solutions for governmental inefficiencies. But we shouldn’t necessarily be surprised by this, as the Centre – and Pat in particular – have always held this theme as a main sticking point of their platforms.</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned reform bills, Speaker Pat also introduced the Homeland Security Act – which codifies the Office of Homeland Security as an office under the Department of Justice. These three bills account for 23.1% of the total bills introduced in this senate session to date. It is clear that the poll’s respondents are pleased with Speaker Pat’s resilience, sharpness, and activity in the senate.&nbsp;</p><h6 id="sen-bternarytau-ind-515-net-approval">Sen. BTernaryTau (Ind) – 51.5% Net Approval</h6><p>Senatrix BTernaryTau (or “Tau”) is an Independent, and she is one of two Independent senators in the 134th Senate – the only one if you don’t count Senator FLY GUY. Senatrix Tau was elected with 6 first-place votes. Senatrix Tau is an experienced political player in SimDem. She has served the nation as President, an MP, and a ten-time Senatrix. As the final elimination in the 133rd Senate, it is no surprise that she has mustered enough support to be elected to the 134th.</p><p>Much of Tau’s legislative forte is in mathematics and political quantitative analysis. A salient example of this is their proposed and passed Threshold Equal Approval Voting Amendment. Tau has pursued passing this Amendment for multiple senate terms – even if she wasn’t a senator for some of them. This bill is Tau’s only proposed bill this Senate session to date, and, as such, the TEA Voting Amendment accounts for 7.7% of the total bills introduced in this senate session to date.</p><p>The poll’s respondents have obviously recognized Senatrix Tau’s experience and trust her judgment in the Senate. It is thus no surprise that she has the third-highest approval rating in the 134th Senate.&nbsp;<br></p><h6 id="sen-josephstalinxdxdxdxd-npp-499-net-approval">Sen. JosephStalinXDXDXDXD (NPP) – 49.9% Net Approval</h6><p>Senator JosephStalinXDXDXDXD (or “Stalin”) is a member of the New People’s Party, and he is one of two senators from the NPP in the 134th Senate. In the 133rd Senate, Stalin served as its speaker, facilitating the debate, amendments, and votes for over 30 bills. His approval ratings spiked during the middle of the 133rd Senate to 49.8%, and he remains stable in this poll – though I’m sure he won’t complain about the extra 0.1% bump up. Speaking of consistency, it is likely Stalin’s reliability in the Senate that allows him to enjoy such favorable net approval ratings. Stalin is an experienced member of SimDemocracy – having first been elected in the 18th Senate.</p><p>Stalin has been active in the 134th Senate as an avid yet open-minded debater. His two bills – the Senate Leadership and Committees Act and the Senate Rules and Procedures Act – both aim at providing redress for existing governmental inefficiencies. But it’s not necessarily the content of these bills that is interesting. It’s the level of debate that Stalin goes through in order to make them the most amenable to the public.</p><p>Throughout the debate periods for each bill, Stalin has listened to the concerns of Senators – only rebutting a claim if he thinks that there is indeed a better solution. It is this level of open-mindedness and willingness to debate on both his bills – which comprise 15.4% of the total bills introduced in this senate session to date – and other Senators’ bills which have conceivably allowed him to steadily carry his approval rating from the 133rd forward to today.&nbsp;<br></p><h6 id="sen-olive-lp-393-net-approval">Sen. Olive (LP) – 39.3% Net Approval</h6><p>Senator Olive is a member of the Lemon Party – a legacy and well-established party. That being said, it seems like Lemon put forward some fresh faces from the orchard, as both Olive and Thyme are relatively new to SimDem. Olive is a frequent contributor to debate, and their central policy focuses seem to revolve around economic and monetary policy. Given their newness to the Senate, it is likely that Senator Olive’s approval rating is largely in the honeymoon phase.&nbsp;</p><h6 id="sen-thyme-lp-393-net-approval">Sen. Thyme (LP) – 39.3% Net Approval</h6><p>Like Senator Olive, Senator Thyme is also a Lemon Party member. To add onto both her and Olive’s similarities, they both have extremely similar net approval ratings.<br></p><p>Thyme was elected after the CTSA-spurred certification of the 134th Senate election and – like Senator Olive – is likely still in a honeymoon approval phase, though possibly for different reasons. Thyme is an avid debater in all matters and questions every nominee or bill proposal. Even if she is a freshman Senator, she has made her mark in debate.&nbsp;<br></p><div><hr class="separator separator--dots"><center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center><br><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="" alt="" class="ad" data-is-external-image="true"><hr class="separator separator--dots"></div><h6 id="sen-fly-guy-ind-327-net-approval">Sen. FLY GUY (Ind) – 32.7% Net Approval</h6><p>Senator FLY GUY originally ran for the 134th Senate as an independent but later joined the New People’s Party. For the purpose of current statistics, we have made statistical analyses below which classify him as both an Independent and a member of the New People’s Party.</p><p>Senator FLY GUY, like Thyme and Kelvin, was elected into the 134th Senate after the CTSA certification of the 134th Senate Election. Their main point of concern is the state of SimDem’s monetary policy, as evidenced by their sole bill proposal in this senate to date: the Central Banking Establishment Act. This bill comprises 7.7% of the total bills introduced in this senate session to date. It is probable that many respondents don’t know how to feel yet about FLY GUY – much like many of the freshman senators on this list.&nbsp;<br></p><h6 id="sen-notlukadebil-snp-154-net-approval">Sen. NotLukaDebiL (SNP) – 15.4% Net Approval</h6><p>Senator NotLukaDebiL (or “Luka”) is a member of the SimDem Nationalist Party, and it is his second Senate campaign – albeit his first successful one. Senator Luka has introduced two bills this senate session: the Job-Finder Act 2025 and the Repeal of the Marriage Law. While the JFA didn’t pass the Senate, the Repeal of the Marriage Act did with flying colors. Luka’s bills are based on good-intentioned ideals and tend to stem from the idea of creating equitable opportunities for all citizens of SimDem while eliminating problematic legislation from the equation.</p><p>Luka’s bills comprise 15.4% of the total bills introduced in this senate session to date – the exact same percentage as his net approval rating. If Luka’s approval ratings are indeed tied to the number of bills he introduces, then all he needs to increase his approval is to introduce more bills.&nbsp;<br></p><h6 id="sen-dovahkiin-spqr-86-net-approval">Sen. Dovahkiin (SPQR) – 8.6% Net Approval</h6><p>Senator Dovahkiin (or “Dovah”) is a member of Senatus Populusque Romanum – another legacy and well-established SimDem party. Senator Dovah has neither been particularly active in the 134th’s debates nor votes, and he has the fourth-lowest approval rating – making it curious as to how or why he was elected in the first place. However, Senator Dovah’s voting data may shine some light on this conundrum.</p><p>Dovah was elected with the second-most first-place votes – eight – but has the fourth-lowest approval rating. This indicates that he has a central group that favors his experience and supports him, but not many others necessarily approve of him. To reliably analyze and extrapolate more specifics as to Dovah’s approval trends, we will need to see more activity from him.</p><h6 id="sen-noll-ind-07-net-approval">Sen. Noll (Ind) – -0.7% Net Approval</h6><p>Senator Noll is an independent senator, and he is the President of Voices of Democracy. He is a frequent contributor to Senate debates and has been a curious and avid learner. As the President of Voices of Democracy, it is likely that much of his disapproval ratings come from respondents who are unhappy with his affiliation with VoD. Like many Senate newcomers, we cannot accurately analyze Noll’s approval causes until we see more activity from and/or data on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><h6 id="sen-eleanor-qqq-175-net-approval">Sen. Eleanor (QQQ) – -17.5% Net Approval</h6><p>Senator Eleanor is a member of the Queer Queens Qlub, and she is an incumbent member of the 133rd Senate. Eleanor has not submitted any bills in this Senate session, but she has been an integral contributor to debate. It is likely that, despite this contribution, the respondents do not look favorably upon her given the recent controversial arrests and trials of QQQ members and affiliates DominaX, Kassady, Decatherinated, and NotCom.&nbsp;</p><h6 id="sen-kelvin-fbp-335-net-approval">Sen. Kelvin (FBP) – -33.5% Net Approval</h6><p>Senator Kelvin is a member of the Fucking Best Party, and he is a long-time incumbent, as he has served the Senate continuously since before the Danyo Immigration Wave. What is curious, though, is how he was elected to the 134th Senate in the first place. What we know as of now is he was elected into the 134th Senate after the CTSA certification of the 134th Senate Election. Unlike Dovah, Senator Kelvin is active in Senate votes. However, much like Senator Dovah, he likely has a central group that favors his experience and supports him, but not many others necessarily approve of him.</p><h4 id="lessugreaterparty-statisticslessugreater"><u>Party Statistics</u></h4><p>During this senate, thirteen bills have been introduced. The following are rankings of the Senators who have proposed bills, ranked by the number of bills proposed:</p><div><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/21584315"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21584315/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" data-is-external-image="true"></noscript></div></div><ul><li>1st Place (4): Senator mypenjustbroke</li><li>2nd Place (3): Speaker Ppatpat</li><li>3rd Place-Tie (2): Senator JosephStalinXDXDXDXD</li><li>3rd Place-Tie (2): Senator NotLukaDebiL</li><li>5th Place-Tie (1): Senatrix BTernaryTau</li><li>5th Place-Tie (1): Senator FLY GUY&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>Next, we will show you how many bills each party has essentially proposed to the Senate.</p><div><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/21584304"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21584304/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" data-is-external-image="true"></noscript></div><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/21584350"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21584350/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" data-is-external-image="true"></noscript></div></div><ul><li>1st Place (7 with FLY GUY, 6 without FLY GUY): New People’s Party</li><li>2nd Place (3): The Centre</li><li>3rd-Tie Place (2): SimDem Nationalist Party</li><li>3rd-Tie Place (2 with FLY GUY): Independents</li><li>4th Place (1) without FLY GUY): Independents&nbsp;<br></li></ul><h6 id="new-peoples-party">New People’s Party</h6><p>The New People’s Party holds between 16.66% and 25% of the seats in the 134th Senate, but they have proposed between 46.2% and 53.8% of all of the proposed bills. This proportion tracks partially because of the NPP’s Senate delegates. The political players within NPP – namely MyPenJustBroke and Stalin – are experienced bill writers with clear legislative preferences and goals.</p><h6 id="the-centrelessbrgreater">The Centre<br></h6><p>The Centre holds just 8.33% of the Senate seats – with Ppatpat being the sole delegate. However, the party is very similar to the NPP in that their bill proposal numbers punch above their weight. The Centre has proposed 23.1% of the bills introduced in this Senate session to date. Additionally, Ppatpat is another adept political player who is both versed in bill writing and Senate procedure.&nbsp;</p><h6 id="simdem-nationalist-party">SimDem Nationalist Party</h6><p>Like the Centre, SNP holds just 8.33% of the Senate seats, as Luka is the sole SNP delegate to the 134th. That being said, the SNP has proposed 15.4% of the bills in this Senate session to date. This points much more to Luka’s ability to recognize and write electorate-supported bills while also presenting platform-compliant legislation, as is seen by both of his proposals in this Senate.&nbsp;</p><h6 id="independents">Independents</h6><p>Independents hold between 8.33% and 16.66% of the Senate seats, but they have proposed between 7.7% and 15.4% of the bills introduced in this Senate to date. These statistics, no matter which party you assign FLY GUY to, suggest that independents are toeing the line with specific single-issue bills which match their personal platforms – as is further evidenced by Tau’s sole introduction of the TEA Voting Amendment.&nbsp;</p><h6 id="independent-voter-leanings">Independent Voter Leanings</h6><p>Of the 37 poll respondents, seven of those respondents – or 18.92% – self-identify as independent voters. In order to better understand where these independent voters lie ideologically, we asked them to select a party that they most identify with, if there was any.&nbsp;</p><div><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/21576684"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21576684/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" data-is-external-image="true"></noscript></div></div><p>Three of the seven – or 42.9% – independent respondents responded that they lean the most towards the New People’s Party. One respondent – or 14.3% – leaned the most towards the Nationalist Action Party/Revolutionary Action Party. Another one respondent identified with the Centre, and the last two respondents – or 28.6% – did not lean towards any party in particular.<br></p><div><h4>Share article:</h4><center><button onclick="copyURL()">Copy link</button><script>function copyURL() {
