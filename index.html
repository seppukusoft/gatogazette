    <h1>An apology</h1>
    <p>On April 17, the Gazette published an article about recent arrests and actions by the SimDemocracy Department of Justice that included leaked classified information. Some of the information shared in the article compromised the identity of a government agent by which intelligence on TIDE was gathered.</p>
    <p>This was a grave error; we as an organization never intended to put anyone at risk of retaliation or harm an active investigation. We have since learned that the agent in question will likely soon be doxxed.</p> 
<p>We are deeply sorry, but more importantly, <strong>I, Gato, am sorry and take full responsibility.</strong></p>
<p>I never intended for anything like this to happen and will take whatever steps are seen as necessary to remedy it.</p>
<p>Effective immediately, the Gazette will be ceasing operations. The staff is currently deliberating as to whether continue polling services, but I cannot in good conscience continue with journalism and possibly put others at risk.</p>  
<p>Announcements related to our stock and polling will come in the near future, from me or from others.</p>
<p>Lastly, I provided a personal message representing solely my own views and feelings on the matter below.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding, your support, and I wish you all health and safety.</p>
