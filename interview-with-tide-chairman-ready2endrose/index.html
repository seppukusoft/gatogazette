The interview transcript has been edited for grammar and pacing, but is otherwise unedited.
</code></pre><p><b>How did you find and join SimDem?</b></p><p>One of my friends and party founder [Erob] knew I liked politics and referred me to it. They had the idea to create the party actually but wanted me to be the figurehead.</p><p><b>You joined the SimDem server and near-immediately made a lengthy post about ROSE and QQQ. Since you're so new but commenting on old drama, many have accused you of being an alt. What is your official comment on those accusations?&nbsp;</b><br></p><p>I joined this server with one goal, to call out ROSE and their long history of wrecking SimDemocracy. The fact that some are scrambling to label me an "alt" instead of addressing what I’m saying only proves how desperate they are to dodge the truth. I’ve done my research and I’ve talked to the people who lived through the chaos the QQQ caused, and I’m not here to play along with their revisionist history. If my presence shakes them, maybe they should take a hard look at why.<br></p><p>Let's get something straight. I’m far from the only one who sees through ROSE’s lies. Plenty of long-time SimDemocracy members have been harassed, sabotaged, and targeted by these same people, and now ROSE wants everyone to forget about it. We will not allow this to happen. These people spent days attacking anyone who stood in their way, and now they want to hide behind another shell party for their failure of the original. But no matter how much they try to deflect, they don’t get to erase what they’ve done. We will not allow them to erase what they have done.</p><p><b>ROSE have defended themselves by noting that the QQQ members with a history of slur usage and/or harassment (ex. Domina, Kassady, etc.) are not in ROSE and, in fact, no longer in the server. Given this, why is the TVDP continuing its attacks on ROSE?</b></p><p>ROSE can claim they’ve cut ties with QQQ’s worst offenders, but their actions tell a different story. They still harbor figures like Decatherinated/High Show. Harboring isn't even the right word since they basically lead the party. They've caused direct harm to TVDP members and perhaps did not participate in the same slur usage as other members but vehemently defended those who did. If they truly wanted a fresh start, they wouldn’t keep those who embody the same toxicity they claim to reject. The TVDP isn’t attacking ROSE, we’re holding them accountable for their hypocrisy and ongoing attempts to undermine order in SimDemocracy.</p><p><b>To clarify, are you asserting that Decatherinated and High Show are the same person or simply both are leading the party?</b></p><p>Same person.</p><div><hr class="separator separator--dots"><center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center><br><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="" alt="" class="ad" data-is-external-image="true"><hr class="separator separator--dots"></div><p><b>What is your evidence for that accusation?</b></p><p>This is technically circumstantial evidence, but the timing and sequence of events raise serious suspicions. Given the close range of server join dates between Decautherinated [<i>sic</i>]&nbsp;and High Show, we believe there is a strong likelihood that High Show is, in fact, an alternate account created to bypass the consequences of Decautherinated’s [<i>sic</i>] actions.<br><br>Decautherinated [<i>sic</i>] was fully aware of the illegality of her future actions days before committing them, which ultimately led to her arrest. The sudden appearance of High Show, closely following these events, suggests an intentional effort to evade the judicial system and continue participation in SimDem under a different identity. The behavioral patterns, engagement style, and political involvement of High Show align too closely with those of Decautherinated [<i>sic</i>] for this to be dismissed as mere coincidence.<br><br>Given these factors, we strongly suspect that High Show is an alt account created to allow Decautherinated [<i>sic</i>] to re-enter SimDem’s political sphere despite her ban. This represents not only a subversion of justice but a deliberate attempt to manipulate the system while avoiding accountability.</p><hr class="separator separator--long-line"><pre class="language-html"><code>We reached out to Blanche (High Show) and Decatherinated for comment on these allegations. They simultaneously refuted "this nonsense in the strongest terms" and highlighted their transparency, while noting that Decatherinated has been in the server as early as 2022 and is, in fact, not banned.

In addition, they requested that the following images be offered for confirmation of that fact with attached captions for context.

The list of individuals includes prominent SimDem members, including ones strongly opposed to the QQQ and ROSE. Why do you think a public list of enemies is necessary and why were those individuals selected despite having an ideological similarity with your party?</b></p><p><b><br></b>TIDE does not take the identification of adversaries lightly. The list in question is not about petty political disagreements but about recognizing those who have actively worked against our mission, our members, and the fundamental values we stand for.</p><p>While there may be individuals who claim to oppose ROSE or QQQ, opposition to one corrupt force does not automatically mean alignment with TIDE. Many of those listed have either enabled or remained complicit in the suppression of our movement. Some have weaponized moderation powers, influenced unjust enforcement actions, or sought to undermine our ability to participate in SimDemocracy on equal footing.</p><p>A public record of those who have acted in bad faith is necessary for transparency and accountability. TIDE will not allow history to be rewritten by those who wish to claim ideological alignment while simultaneously working against our cause. We stand by our commitment to protecting traditional values and ensuring that all actions against TIDE are brought to light.</p><p><b>How can so many people have acted in opposition to your movement when the list was posted only a few hours after you made your call to stop ROSE and before TVDP'S existence was even made public?</b></p><p>TIDE*, and we consider association / membership to ROSE / QQQ opposition to our movement, which is why the list was compiled so immediately as we already were aware of some members / associates.</p><div><hr class="separator separator--dots"><center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center><br><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="" alt="" class="ad" data-is-external-image="true"><hr class="separator separator--dots"></div><p><b>Since the party's name changed mid-interview, could you explain the meaning of the TIDE acronym?</b></p><p>TIDE stands for Traditionalist Insurgency for Defense and Enforcement. It represents our mission to resist ideological subversion, defend SimDemocracy’s traditions, and enforce order against those who seek to destabilize it. Our name reflects our commitment to preserving values and pushing back against those who undermine them. Also, party members agreed with [Senya] that the TIDE acronym and individual meanings better represented the party than the former name.</p><p><b>You stated that your opposition to ROSE was based on research since you asserted you aren't an alt. What is your response to those who point out that your party is made of people who are either very new to SimDem or are not even in the server, but claim to uphold SimDem's traditions?
