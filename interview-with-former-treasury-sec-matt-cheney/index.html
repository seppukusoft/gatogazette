What led to your decision to resign?</h6><p>I have been in that role for ten weeks after this election ends. I always knew I wanted to go and do something else eventually because my plan wasn't even to be Treasury Secretary, but I feel that I did a lot in the department and even though I love that job just that it was time for a change for myself.</p><h6 id="you-mention-you-wanted-change-how-has-the-role-affected-you-personally" class="align-center">You mention you wanted change; how has the role affected you personally?</h6><p>Well, I'm not gonna lie; for the first week or two in the role I didn't feel like I was allowed to have a life. I felt like I had to be glued to my screen in case I missed something important that I was needed for, but I learned that isn't the case. I feel like I've been pretty outspoken about people bothering government officials or really anyone with a job on the server because it can make you feel a little trapped. Other than that, all of the effects have been positive. I have met a bunch of people and heard different points of view I never would have otherwise. Serving SimDem in this way has given me things I wouldn't have without the role, so I will always be thankful for this stop in my SimDem story.</p><h6 id="was-there-a-specific-moment-or-event-that-solidified-your-decision-to-step-down" class="align-center">Was there a specific moment or event that solidified your decision to step down?</h6><p>No, not anything specifically. I just knew after last election that I needed a change; I normally don't do one thing for too long anyways, plus ten weeks in the role just sounds nice lmao.</p><h6 id="did-you-feel-adequately-supported-by-the-rest-of-the-administration-whether-through-public-response-or-privately" class="align-center">Did you feel adequately supported by the rest of the administration, whether through public response or privately?</h6><p>Yeah! When I went on vacation under Muggy, they told me I could take as much time as necessary and I told Ferris it would be my last term before they were even elected. Everyone has supported me and been as nice as possible through the whole process.</p><h6 id="thats-great-to-hear-looking-back-what-do-you-consider-your-greatest-achievement-in-office" class="align-center">That's great to hear! Looking back, what do you consider your greatest achievement in office?</h6><p>I would say the amount of businesses opened. Writing legislation and giving orders and stuff is fun, but when someone opens a business they open themselves up to a risk. Since my confirmation, over 40 businesses have taken that risk to try to better themselves but also the economy as a whole. It genuinely makes me happy to know that people are coming up with ideas and doing what they can to expand our economy everyday; nothing could replace that to me.</p><div><hr class="separator separator--dots"><center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center><br><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="" alt="" class="ad" data-is-external-image="true"><hr class="separator separator--dots"></div><h6 id="on-the-topic-of-business-and-more-specifically-the-economy-how-would-you-describe-the-current-state-of-simdems-finances" class="align-center">On the topic of business and more specifically the economy, how would you describe the current state of SimDem’s finances?</h6><p>I think it's improving, just slowly. I think sometimes people forget where we were a few weeks ago when I took over. Stipends hadn't been paid in at least a week, pay took at a minimum double the time it takes now, the Treasury Department had 3-4 less departments, and there had been very little contact between the economy and the public. Change, especially in economics, is incredibly slow and I think that, as much as people rightly think we should have a better economy than we do now, we should also be proud of the improvements we have made so far. After being able to work with both current options for my replacement, I have nothing but faith in the fact that either one of them will be able to not only continue the positive growth, but put us on an even faster track.</p><h6 id="you-believe-there-was-little-contact-between-the-economy-and-the-public-back-then-i-want-to-extend-my-question-to-ask-whats-your-view-on-simdems-current-approach-to-economic-transparencyandnbsplessbrgreater" class="align-center">You believe there was little contact between the economy and the public back then. I want to extend my question to ask what’s your view on SimDem’s current approach to economic transparency?&nbsp;<br></h6><p>Well, the Treasury's spending records have been public for a few weeks and I've responded to all three FOIAs I've received (I was the first Treasury Sec. the FOIA was passed under), but I also have answered every question anyone has asked me to the best of my ability. Public interaction is never something I've backed away from.</p><h6 id="speaking-of-foias-you-might-have-received-some-from-external-government-agencies-did-the-treasury-ever-clash-with-other-government-departments" class="align-center">Speaking of FOIAs, you might have received some from external government agencies. Did the Treasury ever clash with other government departments?</h6><p>No, never. We maintained good relations with all departments because we have to work with all departments, but also because there were never any issues. I loved serving with all of my fellow cabinet members across all four presidents.</p><h6 id="when-you-mean-all-departments-i-cant-help-but-think-of-the-senate-how-did-you-coordinate-financial-decisions-with-the-president-and-senate-especially-with-any-financial-bills-passed" class="align-center">When you mean all departments, I can't help but think of the Senate. How did you coordinate financial decisions with the President and Senate, especially with any financial bills passed?</h6><p>Honestly, most financial decisions are necessary ones; I tried to make a budget process that would make the legislative and executive have to debate a budget for every presidential term but I had to get it repealed because it just didn't work. I do plan on writing a new budget bill to get that process up and running, but it just didn't work the way it was supposed to as written.</p><h6 id="on-the-topic-of-budgeting-how-did-you-approach-budgeting-for-government-departments" class="align-center">On the topic of budgeting, how did you approach budgeting for government departments?</h6><p>There wasn't really anything that detailed any exact process, I normally just reached out to the head of the department and we hashed out any details between us. I would then get presidential approval of that number before making it official and sending it.</p><h6 id="were-there-any-reforms-you-wanted-to-pursue-but-couldnt" class="align-center">Were there any reforms you wanted to pursue but couldn’t?</h6><p>There were definitely a few things I wasn't able to do, but I plan on releasing some plans on the economy and loads of other issues in <u>my campaign for the 139th Senate.</u></p><h6 id="the-139th-senate" class="align-center">The 139th Senate?</h6><p><u>The Senate election that starts next week I will be running in!</u></p><h6 id="youve-just-stepped-down-as-treasury-secretary-and-now-youre-looking-to-win-a-senate-seat-what-changed-or-was-this-always-the-plan" class="align-center">You’ve just stepped down as Treasury Secretary, and now you're looking to win a Senate seat. What changed? Or was this always the plan?</h6><p>My initial plan after joining was to run for Senate after working for Mypen for a bit, so this was kinda always my plan, they just got changed because of how much I enjoyed the job.</p><h6 id="what-qualifies-you-to-shift-from-managing-money-to-making-laws" class="align-center">What qualifies you to shift from managing money to making laws?</h6><p>Well I've written multiple laws, a majority of which passed the Senate, and on the campaign trail I plan on releasing at least one policy outlook per day. One of the biggest problems in SimDem, in my opinion, is the way that campaigns are set up. Right now, candidates run for a very short period of time and don't release enough information for voters truly base their vote on. I plan to change that by running a campaign that grabs people's attention and shows people that we can do things differently.&nbsp;<br></p><h6 id="some-might-say-that-your-record-as-treasury-secretary-is-now-campaign-material-do-you-welcome-that-scrutiny" class="align-center">Some might say that your record as Treasury Secretary is now campaign material; do you welcome that scrutiny?</h6><p>I have no problem with people looking back at what I've done and judging me. I have never claimed to be perfect and no matter what anyone says about my time in the department, I'm proud of what we did to further SimDem. Nobody can say anything to take that away from me or the countless other people who helped me through these ten weeks.</p><h6 id="hypothetically-speaking-why-should-the-same-people-who-struggled-under-your-financial-policies-now-trust-you-with-legislative-power" class="align-center">Hypothetically speaking, why should the same people who struggled under your financial policies now trust you with legislative power?</h6><p>Well first of all, I'd say they don't have to. On the campaign trail, and if I'm lucky enough to win the election, I will talk to and represent every SimDem citizen, not just those who liked my financial policies and if I see any way to improve on them I won't hesitate to act to do so. You can always be better, and me and my policies are no different.</p><div><hr class="separator separator--dots"><center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center><br><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="" alt="" class="ad" data-is-external-image="true"><hr class="separator separator--dots"></div><h6 id="what-separates-you-from-the-other-senate-hopefuls-besides-your-title" class="align-center">What separates you from the other Senate hopefuls besides your title?</h6><p>I think that is up for voters to decide after all the candidates have made some statements in the campaign. Of course I think that I would do great in the job and represent the people well, but so does every other candidate, so I don't think that there's anything that separates us yet.</p><h6 id="do-you-believe-the-senate-has-been-effective-in-recent-terms-if-not-how-would-you-change-that" class="align-center">Do you believe the Senate has been effective in recent terms? If not, how would you change that?</h6><p>I think the problems with the Senate recently have been some legislative and some personality. I think earlier today [election day] was a good example where the Senate rushed to impeachments that may not have been necessary. I think at times the Senate needs a moral leader who can be someone others look to in times like these. SimDem needs level-headed, common sense thinkers in office, not reactionaries who do what may seem right in the short term, but are actually negative long term.</p><h6 id="you-stated-the-senate-needs-moral-leadership-what-does-that-look-like-in-practice" class="align-center">You stated the Senate needs moral leadership. What does that look like in practice?</h6><p>It looks like someone stepping up and saying what needs to be said. This morning, any Senator could have slowed things down and waited until there was actual evidence before making claims or motioning for impeachment, but they didn't. When you're dealing with things of that nature, you need to be patient and wait for all relevant information to be released instead of relying on #general for your evidence.</p><h6 id="when-the-senate-acts-out-of-emotion-or-reaction-whats-the-long-term-damage-to-simdems-institutions" class="align-center">When the Senate acts out of emotion or reaction, what’s the long-term damage to SimDem’s institutions?</h6><p>Well, some of it is visible and tangible immediately, but the real toll is trust in SimDem's institutions. This goes for everyone in power, not just the Senate, but if people in power continually rush important decisions, people will not trust those in power. Losing the trust of the public is a dangerous game to play if you want to accomplish anything.</p><h6 id="what-lessons-from-your-time-as-treasury-secretary-would-you-bring-into-senate-deliberations-especially-during-moments-like-today" class="align-center">What lessons from your time as Treasury Secretary would you bring into Senate deliberations especially during moments like today?</h6><p>Patience. Being on the older side of SimDem figures (22 y/o), I have a different perspective compared to a lot of other people. Things can always be painted any way someone wants in the short term; the long term is what separates fact from lie.</p><h6 id="how-would-you-plan-to-work-with-senators-who-have-publicly-displayed-their-disapproval-or-hatred-of-you-or-your-departments-various-activities" class="align-center">How would you plan to work with senators who have publicly displayed their disapproval or hatred of you or your department's various activities?</h6><p>I don't hold those kinds of things against people. I will work with whoever I can to make SimDem better, no matter what they have said or thought of me in the past.</p><h6 id="interesting-do-you-believe-your-financial-leadership-has-earned-the-trust-of-voters-now-that-youre-seeking-a-senate-seat" class="align-center">Interesting. Do you believe your financial leadership has earned the trust of voters now that you're seeking a Senate seat?</h6><p>I hope it has, but for anyone that it hasn't, I plan on campaigning as hard as I can to earn that trust. If nothing else, I owe SimDem that.</p><h6 id="with-the-appointment-of-logry-as-the-next-secretary-of-treasury-what-advice-would-you-give-to-him" class="align-center">With the appointment of Logry as the next Secretary of Treasury, what advice would you give to him?</h6><p>Logry not only doesn't need my advice, but he knows if he ever wants it, I'm just a message away. I'm glad you asked this because it gives me a chance to say how much confidence and faith I have in him to do even more than I did. Mypen made a great choice by picking him.</p><h6 id="always-a-pleasure-as-a-final-comment-what-do-you-say-to-those-to-supported-your-endeavors-throughout-the-ten-weeks-in-your-position-as-treasury-secretary" class="align-center">Always a pleasure. As a final comment, what do you say to those to supported your endeavors throughout the ten weeks in your position as Treasury Secretary?</h6><p>I say thank you. I joined this server not imagining that I would ever hold any position, so this has been incredibly important and humbling to me. Every supporter means the world to me. I hope that I'm able to continue to justify the love!</p><div><h4>Share article:</h4><center><button onclick="copyURL()">Copy link</button><script>function copyURL() {
