We cannot build a functioning economy if everyone has a completely different view of how that economy should operate at the fundamental level. While I openly identify myself on the left, clear by my former leadership of the LUF and activity within the SDPB before my resignation, I feel it is fundamental to make the economy an area of bipartisan agreement to ensure the best outcome, not strained by controversy.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    A few days before Imade’s election, more than two weeks ago, I was privately confirmed as the SDPB’s pick for Secretary of the Treasury. Almost immediately, I researched everything that I could find, discovering there was only a single valid law on the economy, the very one that established the role I had been nominated for and the Tau as a currency. From there, it didn’t take me long to work out what really needed to change. I and my co-writer, former LUF member Jimmy Fallon, began work on a lengthy plan; the framework of this economic dossier was later redrafted and adopted as the key consensus for Imade’s administration. This was all based on three missions:\n  </p>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>Increasing Employment</li><li>Creation of New Businesses</li><li>Increasing Economic Activity of Citizens\n</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <p>\n    Once we had assembled the dossier and come up with several policies to achieve those aims, we were quickly halted by the slow-moving and often criticised 132nd Senate, the last to feature such a small count of senators holding the entire executive branch back from being able to work. The cabinet wasn’t confirmed in their positions for nearly an entire week, half of the entire term. By the time that I and my colleagues were confirmed, I was quickly thrown into utter shock.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Most new governments complain about their inheritance and how the books aren’t balanced or the general state of things. However, when I got into the backend of the Treasury, I quickly discovered that there was no inheritance. At all. All the businesses and all the spending that the government had conducted for months were being entirely unaccounted for. We quite simply had no records. This is not only a disgrace for the former administration but it left me and the other workers within the Treasury to spend countless hours making spreadsheets, tracking down data, and registering every single business into proper government files.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    On top of this, I became ill the next week and I simply didn’t have time to fulfill the demanding role of creating and keeping spreadsheets up to date, registering new business accounts, handing out government stipends, and also fulfilling our full economic plan (which we released around that time). So, I resigned in an attempt to get out of the way and allow Imade to push forward with the agenda; sadly, this move hasn’t been as effective as I'd thought.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Moving forward now, with a new Treasury Secretary who I can personally vouch for as a very engaged and effective aide within the Treasury, work needs to be done. However, this work can not come from Imade’s cabinet alone: the Senate needs to get on board and work directly with them to author legislation on many of the proposals in the consensus.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    For example, an independent central bank would be massively beneficial if set up correctly and headed by the right people. The power of printing currency and official loans would be much better handled by an organisation built to do so and not government officials that come and go often. How can money be effectively managed when, theoretically, a new administration could come into power every two weeks? Some of this power needs to be transferred away into a new independent body to bring activity into the economy.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The system needs to be easier as well; the threads to claim government stipends and create businesses are hidden away, and people need to be encouraged to go beyond just forming a special bank account and creating businesses. This is effectively deregulation of the discord server, but it isn’t some nutty new-right style of letting the markets run free. Rather, it's a managed jump start of the service-based economy we're running.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The people need to want to engage with the economy, and to do this we need to make sure people know how it actually works. That is why I introduced the economic noticeboard as a basic tutorial of the system, but that isn’t enough alone.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    We must go further and I believe, under Imade’s presidency and with hard-working senators, we can achieve the change we need.<br>\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--long-line\" />\n<div><h4>Share article:</h4>\n<center>\n<button onclick=\"copyURL()\">Copy link</button>\n<script>\nfunction copyURL() {\n let url = document.location.href\nnavigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(function() {\n    console.log('Copied!');\n}, function() {\n    console.log('Copy error')\n});\n}\n</script>\n</center>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.commoninja.com/sdk/latest/commonninja.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"commonninja_component pid-bce4f8ea-9bd1-4793-88bc-63467f850c33\"></div>\n</div>",

Ppatpat's profile picture.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\" />\n<pre id=\"test\" class=\"line-numbers  language-html\"><code>The interview transcript has been edited for grammar, but is otherwise unedited.</code></pre>\n\n    <h5 id=\"what-motivated-you-to-seek-another-term-in-the-senate\" class=\"align-center\">\n      What motivated you to seek another term in the Senate?\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    Well, I had actually been grappling with the question of whether I should seek a second term for a while.<br><br>I had been speaking with my closest colleagues in the senate, mypen and Niko, about whether our time contributing to SimDem was over. I guess part of me felt a bit of burnout, I had gotten all my major legislation passed. However, I realised that there’s still work to be done. In my first term, I focused on building a foundation for reform—whether it was spearheading the SimDem Independent Oversight Authority Act to ensure accountability, passing the Freedom of Information Act to bring transparency, or crafting amendments like the By-elections Act and changes to the Senate Procedures Act to strengthen our democratic processes.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I’ve been present for every vote, engaged in every debate, and committed to being a steady hand during times of change. But, ultimately, I talked to constituents and realised there's still more to be done; like I said in my announcement, the real question that I asked myself was, can I still give this job everything I have? The day I can’t is the day I step aside. That day is not today. There’s still progress to be made, and I want to continue being a part of it.<br><br>Ultimately, win or lose, I'm incredibly proud of the work I've done in my term as a senator. I hope I've not let anybody down. Nonetheless, I'm sure there are those who think I haven't done a good job, and I'd like to hear from them to see where I can improve.\n<br><br>Today may have been good, but I'll push to do better tomorrow. I think this is something SimDem should also aspire to.<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"what-are-your-goals-for-the-next-term-if-elected\" class=\"align-center\">\n      What are your goals for the next term, if elected?\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    My goals for the next term are clear: to build on the progress we’ve made while tackling the challenges we still face. I want to ensure that SimDemocracy’s institutions remain strong, transparent, and accountable.\n<br>\n<br>Secondly, I want to focus on economic policies that promote activity and fairness.\n<br>\n<br>Finally, I want to continue being a steady hand in the Senate—present for every debate, every vote, and every decision. Because good governance doesn’t just happen; it takes commitment, pragmatism, and a willingness to listen.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    For specific plans, I envision a system where private businesses and individuals can compete transparently for government contracts, ensuring fair competition and delivering value to SimDemocracy. This would provide new economic opportunities while holding contractors accountable for delivering quality work on time.\n<br>\n<br>I also have ideas to to maintain the integrity of our judicial system. I have plans for a bill that formally separates the prosecutorial arm of the DoJ from executive interference. While the attorney general will continue to provide oversight, decisions about prosecutions will rest with an independent board or division within the DoJ, insulated from political pressures. This will prevent any administration from using the DoJ as a political tool and ensure that justice is administered fairly and impartially.\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"what-are-your-views-on-the-ongoing-tensions-with-vod-and-foreign-policy-in-general\" class=\"align-center\">\n      What are your views on the ongoing tensions with VoD and foreign policy in general?\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    Foreign policy isn’t a straight line—it’s a chessboard with about five games going on at once, and some of the pieces don’t even know they’re part of the game.\n<br>\n<br>The tensions here? They’re about power, resources, influence—all the usual suspects. But here’s the thing: you don’t solve this by saber-rattling or by retreating into isolation. You solve it by bringing people to the table. Diplomacy is hard, messy, and slow, but it’s the best tool we’ve got.\n<br>\n<br>Now, foreign policy in general? It’s about values as much as it’s about strategy. It’s about deciding what kind of country we want to be and then making sure the world knows it. Do we want to be the community that leads with strength but tempers it with humility? Or do we want to be the community that throws its weight around without thinking about the consequences? I know which one I’d choose.\n<br><br>And let me tell you something else—foreign policy doesn’t exist in a vacuum. What we do abroad reflects who we are at home. So, if we’re not taking care of things here—our people, our economy, our principles—then all the foreign policy in the world won’t matter. We’ve got to lead by example, plain and simple.\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"what-would-you-say-is-your-biggest-strength-in-regards-to-your-position-your-biggest-weakness\" class=\"align-center\">\n      What would you say is your biggest strength in regards to your position? Your biggest weakness?\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    I’d say my biggest strength is my commitment to consistency and reliability. I’ve been present for every vote, engaged in every debate, and worked tirelessly to ensure that the legislation I support reflects both practical solutions and idealistic values.<br><br>For a weakness, it would be my tendency to take on too much personally. I like to have a hand in drafting, refining, and debating legislation, which sometimes makes delegation harder for me. While I’m learning to trust others more in collaborative efforts, I still struggle with balancing my workload and ensuring that I’m not stretched too thin. But I’d argue that this comes from a place of care—I want to give everything I can to this position.\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"in-25-words-or-less-what-would-you-say-to-convince-an-undecided-voter-to-support-your-campaign\" class=\"align-center\">\n      In 25 words or less, what would you say to convince an undecided voter to support your campaign?\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    I'm a steady hand for meaningful reform. I’ve shown up, delivered results, and fought for transparency, accountability, and progress. Together, we can shape SimDem’s future.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--long-line\" />\n<div><h4>Share article:</h4>\n<center>\n<button onclick=\"copyURL()\">Copy link</button>\n<script>\nfunction copyURL() {\n let url = document.location.href\nnavigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(function() {\n    console.log('Copied!');\n}, function() {\n    console.log('Copy error')\n});\n}\n</script>\n</center>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.commoninja.com/sdk/latest/commonninja.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"commonninja_component pid-bce4f8ea-9bd1-4793-88bc-63467f850c33\"></div>\n</div>",

In past years, members of the \"Civil Liberties Party\" have colluded to attempt to overthrow the government or replace the judiciary with supporters on <i>several</i>&nbsp;occasions. The allegations made in the recently-dropped charges are only the tip of the iceberg. Additionally, members have previously contributed to a toxic atmosphere, even working together to harass political opponents or people who simply disagreed with them.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    As Halfcat noted in <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/554769523635650580/1028641820093202532/1331418552917557318\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"extlink extlink-icon-1\"  >his statement</a>, the CLP's plan to take over last time involved \"creat[ing] a new party, with a friendlier face that claimed to fight for the rights of new people. They would then replace the judiciary with people loyal to them, and finally replace the Supervisors so that there would be no one left to stop them.\"\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The charges against Kelvin and others were based on allegations of a conspiracy to make alternate accounts (\"alts\") to flood the server, elect a friendly president, and solidify their power by attacking and replacing the judiciary. This, if true, would be clearly illegal—the use of alts in this manner (both to vote multiple times and, in Mooklyn's case, evade a ban) is prohibited by the Constitution and Criminal Code.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    In co-opting the \"New People's Party,\" however, they found a solution to that issue: by taking advantage of the SimDem population roughly quintupling in the span of a week, they could create a powerful party with support from real voters who were completely unaware of their previous actions. <b>Gone was the illegal element of their scheme and, with it, the potential for obstruction.</b>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The steps to achieve their goals are already in motion. Kelvin, who is part of the ex-CLP aligned \"Fucking Best Party\" and was a CLP member involved in previous unfavorable activities himself, has recently proposed <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/554769523635650580/1029786104397824131/1331389788816670791\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"extlink extlink-icon-1\"  >a new law</a> in the Senate that increases executive powers and makes it easier to remove judges and supervisors, the two groups best equipped to prevent a power grab.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Given the history of such attempts by prominent members of the FBP and NPP, it is reasonable to fear that this is the beginning of another shot. What's most disheartening, however, is the lack of action against those who have allegedly committed the highest crime in the server. The dropping of all charges was a major blow to public confidence in the government, affecting both the AG's office and the only-recently elected President Imade.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This low-stakes democracy simulation online has been successful for nearly 6 years due to the potential for participants to experience politics, friendship, and fun in one place. The sim has survived through tough times due to the tenacity of its members and the rules and norms that guide it. However, as Halfcat so neatly put it, \"when the crime of trying to destroy SimDemocracy isn’t punished, then none of that other stuff matters. <b>It’s no longer fun, because there is no point.</b>\"\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Without fun, without a point, what is there to gain or lose? There can be no enjoyment if the core of the community is destroyed, tossed aside to boost the egos of a select few through exerting their power in a Discord server.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    We must not allow these destroyers \"victory over the barren wasteland\" because doing so accepts that SimDem is destined to become barren. SimDem has never been more popular and to squander such an opportunity would be a catastrophic loss. After all, we are just beginning to feel the effects of the catastrophic loss of Halfcat, an influential and frankly indispensable member of our community, and he is only one person. <b>The loss of our community, even of our recognition of it, must be avoided at all costs.</b>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    For these reasons, we <b>must</b> take every opportunity to oppose the power grab legislation, the political influence of the suspect members, and any other attempts to harm SimDemocracy. As much as Halfcat's departure affects us, we <b>must</b> carry on by ensuring that his posts are filled with people dedicated to the health of the server, not partisan games and power plays. We <b>must</b> ensure that toxicity and corruption do not become commonplace and push more people away. Finally, we <b>must</b> push for further investigation into the actions behind the dropped charges and improve public confidence in our government.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>Resistance at all levels is the only way to keep SimDem as it should be: fun, not failed.</b>\n  </p>\n<div><h4>Share article:</h4>\n<center>\n<button onclick=\"copyURL()\">Copy link</button>\n<script>\nfunction copyURL() {\n let url = document.location.href\nnavigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(function() {\n    console.log('Copied!');\n}, function() {\n    console.log('Copy error')\n});\n}\n</script>\n</center>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.commoninja.com/sdk/latest/commonninja.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"commonninja_component pid-bce4f8ea-9bd1-4793-88bc-63467f850c33\"></div></div>",

I am running for senate. I do not believe the current senators are doing a good job, nor do I believe they have been completely transparent, honest, or well-intentioned with their actions. I’ll promise you this—I’ll never tell you a lie, not in my campaign, nor my Senate tenure if I may be blessed with one. That is the biggest issue, trust. I think it’s time to turn a new page, away from scandal, That is why I’m running to be your senator.\n<br>\n<br><b>What would you say is your flagship policy?\n</b><br>\n<br>I would say a bicameral legislature would be one of my MOST important policy plans[.]\n<br><br><b>What is your plan to implement a bicameral legislature? How would each house be set up and what would their powers be?\n</b><br>\n<br>I believe the senate size should be reduced so that there is more of a use to a lower house. Additionally, 19 senators (which are how many are accepted currently) are way too much, even factoring in the fact 32 or so candidates are running (more than half!). The proposition for a lower amount, which was made by a member whose name I will not speak, comes off to me as very acceptable. As for the lower chamber, I’m thinking something like the “House of Delegates” to give a member of that lower house a proper name. Furthermore, I believe this HoD should have at least 4-7 members, following a similar formula to the senate. I strongly believe in a lower chamber because they can provide checks and balances to the senate, which can come in handy when the Executive branch cannot or will not. Also, I would like to mention that I agree with fellow candidate Lucas that a lower house would allow for more representation.\n<br><br><b>A recent poll showed that the issues that the voters cared most about when choosing a candidate to support were (in order) \"improving the economy/increasing its use,\" \"senate expansion,\" and \"increasing government efficiency.\"\n<br>First, how do you square your support for a bicameral legislature with the popular demand for simply expanding the Senate?\n<br>Second, what are your positions on the other two issues?\n</b><br>\n<br>First off, if I may combine two issues. A bicameral legislature would actually streamline the government, by blocking some of the more extreme bills the current Senate would paas, and some of the more extreme bills the lower chamber may pass. If anything, it’d allow for a better, faster way for bills to be signed without having to worry about specific contents of the bill. Furthermore, a second legislature would stop a group of senators to just vote the same way to pass the laws they want, and would make the Congress (referring to both this hypothetical lower house and senate) be in line with public interest[.]\n<br>Second off, the economys[sic] a very, very tricky thing to handle. To increase productivity, I would like to suggest some sort of commodities/goods system in which one can spend their money. However, the specifics of this I do not know, and no one else seems to have come up with anything, except Biscuit, who suggested this. I would say I am inclined to support this considering we have no other use for our money anyways.\n<br>As for government efficiency, I am a huge proponent of streamlining the executive branch, and I am an opponent for bureaucratic measures like Executive Senators, which demonstrates an unfair breachment of the seperation of the Legislative and Executive branches. President Imade’s actions to streamline the departments have been amazing and I commend them for their work on the executive branch, and hope to see more. Targeted knockouts and removals of certain branches, channels are imperative for a server thats easy to navigate. I remember when I first joined and couldn’t understand a thing, so I went straight to general.\n<br><br><b>Are there any other views or policies you want the public to know about?\n</b><br>\n<br>I would like the public to know that we do not have to live like this, with this senate. The senate has taken our trust and thrown it out of the window, making provate deals without the public’s interest taken into account. I will be a different Senator, and I promise to never lie during my campaign and tenure[.]\n<br><br><b>Finally, if you could summarize your campaign in a single word, what would it be?\n</b><br>\n<br>Trust.\n  </p>\n<div><h4>Share article:</h4>\n<center>\n<button onclick=\"copyURL()\">Copy link</button>\n<script>\nfunction copyURL() {\n let url = document.location.href\nnavigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(function() {\n    console.log('Copied!');\n}, function() {\n    console.log('Copy error')\n});\n}\n</script>\n</center>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.commoninja.com/sdk/latest/commonninja.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"commonninja_component pid-bce4f8ea-9bd1-4793-88bc-63467f850c33\"></div>\n</div>\n\n  <p>\n    \n  </p>",
