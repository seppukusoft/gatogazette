They had the idea to create the party actually but wanted me to be the figurehead.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>You joined the SimDem server and near-immediately made a lengthy post about ROSE and QQQ. Since you're so new but commenting on old drama, many have accused you of being an alt. What is your official comment on those accusations?&nbsp;</b><br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I joined this server with one goal, to call out ROSE and their long history of wrecking SimDemocracy. The fact that some are scrambling to label me an \"alt\" instead of addressing what I’m saying only proves how desperate they are to dodge the truth. I’ve done my research and I’ve talked to the people who lived through the chaos the QQQ caused, and I’m not here to play along with their revisionist history. If my presence shakes them, maybe they should take a hard look at why.\n<br>\n\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Let's get something straight. I’m far from the only one who sees through ROSE’s lies. Plenty of long-time SimDemocracy members have been harassed, sabotaged, and targeted by these same people, and now ROSE wants everyone to forget about it. We will not allow this to happen. These people spent days attacking anyone who stood in their way, and now they want to hide behind another shell party for their failure of the original. But no matter how much they try to deflect, they don’t get to erase what they’ve done. We will not allow them to erase what they have done.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>ROSE have defended themselves by noting that the QQQ members with a history of slur usage and/or harassment (ex. Domina, Kassady, etc.) are not in ROSE and, in fact, no longer in the server. Given this, why is the TVDP continuing its attacks on ROSE?</b>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    ROSE can claim they’ve cut ties with QQQ’s worst offenders, but their actions tell a different story. They still harbor figures like Decatherinated/High Show. Harboring isn't even the right word since they basically lead the party. They've caused direct harm to TVDP members and perhaps did not participate in the same slur usage as other members but vehemently defended those who did. If they truly wanted a fresh start, they wouldn’t keep those who embody the same toxicity they claim to reject. The TVDP isn’t attacking ROSE, we’re holding them accountable for their hypocrisy and ongoing attempts to undermine order in SimDemocracy.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>To clarify, are you asserting that Decatherinated and High Show are the same person or simply both are leading the party?</b>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Same person.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>What is your evidence for that accusation?</b>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This is technically circumstantial evidence, but the timing and sequence of events raise serious suspicions. Given the close range of server join dates between Decautherinated [<i>sic</i>]&nbsp;and High Show, we believe there is a strong likelihood that High Show is, in fact, an alternate account created to bypass the consequences of Decautherinated’s  [<i>sic</i>] actions.\n<br>\n<br>Decautherinated [<i>sic</i>] was fully aware of the illegality of her future actions days before committing them, which ultimately led to her arrest. The sudden appearance of High Show, closely following these events, suggests an intentional effort to evade the judicial system and continue participation in SimDem under a different identity. The behavioral patterns, engagement style, and political involvement of High Show align too closely with those of Decautherinated [<i>sic</i>] for this to be dismissed as mere coincidence.\n<br>\n<br>Given these factors, we strongly suspect that High Show is an alt account created to allow Decautherinated [<i>sic</i>] to re-enter SimDem’s political sphere despite her ban.

The list in question is not about petty political disagreements but about recognizing those who have actively worked against our mission, our members, and the fundamental values we stand for.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    While there may be individuals who claim to oppose ROSE or QQQ, opposition to one corrupt force does not automatically mean alignment with TIDE.

Some have weaponized moderation powers, influenced unjust enforcement actions, or sought to undermine our ability to participate in SimDemocracy on equal footing.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    A public record of those who have acted in bad faith is necessary for transparency and accountability.

It represents our mission to resist ideological subversion, defend SimDemocracy’s traditions, and enforce order against those who seek to destabilize it. Our name reflects our commitment to preserving values and pushing back against those who undermine them. Also, party members agreed with [Senya] that the TIDE acronym and individual meanings better represented the party than the former name.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>You stated that your opposition to ROSE was based on research since you asserted you aren't an alt.

This mid-migration trend caught nearly every senator except for three: Stalin, Eleanor, and Kelvin. These three Senators ended up running as incumbents for the 134th Senate and retained their seats – some in a more straightforward manner than others.\n<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The only other two incumbent senators who were re-elected are Ppatpat and MyPenJustBroke. These two’s approval trends followed the pack of the other ten senators, as we believe that the Senators exited the honeymoon period – which is colloquially defined as the short period of heightened approval ratings experienced by a person in the beginning periods of their tenure.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    It should be noted, though, that while these two Senators did follow the mid-maxxing approval trend, both MyPen and Ppatpat had the most #1 votes of all of the incumbent senators. This suggests that both senators have strong intra-party and inter-party support, allowing them to continue their legislative work.&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h4 id=\"lessugreaterthe-senators-a-mixed-analysislessugreater\">\n      <u>The Senators (A Mixed Analysis)</u>\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    After the CTSA drama ousted former PUP member zhennyzhenzhen, among others, and brought in FLY GUY, Thyme, and Kelvin, we have been able to conduct an approval poll and report our results here. In addition to reporting the raw “Net Approval” statistic, we will also provide you with our analysis as to why we believe each Senator has achieved their approval level.\n<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    A note for the reader before we get started: Senator FLY GUY’s switch from an independent candidate to the New People’s Party after the 134th Senate Election left many asking where he should be sorted. So, as an amazing example of compromise in the democratic process, I unilaterally decided to include charts and rankings that outline the bill proposals which account for FLY GUY being both an Independent and an NPP Senator.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-mypenjustbroke-npp-735-net-approval\">\n      Sen. MyPenJustBroke (NPP) – 73.5% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator MyPenJustBroke (or “MyPen”) is the Chief Policy Director of the New People’s Party, and he is one of two senators from the NPP in the 134th Senate – one of three if you count Senator FLY GUY. Senator MyPen was elected for the second time with the most first-place votes, amounting to 13 votes. Senator MyPen has the highest approval rating for both 133rd Senate incumbents and for the 134th Senate.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    One of the most striking aspects of Senator MyPen’s tenure is his volume of legislative output. He has introduced four bills this session, accounting for 30.8% of all proposed legislation. His proposals cover a wide range of issues, demonstrating a strategic appeal to different voter bases. Voters tend to gravitate toward candidates who are effective policymakers, and MyPen’s productivity and legislative ambition make him stand out as someone who is not just present but actively shaping the direction of governance.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    \tMyPen’s policy initiatives are not overtly partisan - they often address both economic fairness and governmental efficiency. His popularity appears to stem from an innate ability to appeal across party lines by addressing issues and being the one to form consensus on solutions. He has a high volume of legislation and debate, but doesn’t alienate moderate or conservative voters while doing so.&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-ppatpat-c-698-net-approvallessbrgreater\">\n      Sen. Ppatpat (C) – 69.8% Net Approval<br>\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator Ppatpat (or “Pat”) is the leader of the Centre, and the only senator from the Centre in the 134th Senate. The Centre delegate held the third-most first-place votes in the 134th Senate Election, with seven under his belt. Immediately after his election, he campaigned and won the 134th Speaker election. Speaker Pat was undoubtedly thrown into interesting times in the first few days of his speakership.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    For one, he was forced to invalidate all nominations and legislative votes after the DoJ’s use of the CTSA forced the Senate into limbo. After the final certification of the votes pulled four senator-hopefuls out of the 134th and brought three (mostly) fresh faces in, Speaker Pat reintroduced the votes and expediently went about Senate business. Most recently, Speaker Pat facilitated the Senate’s passage of the current State of Caution, enacted in response to the PUP’s recent threats and incursions against SimDemocracy private party and organizational servers.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Speaker Pat’s introduced bills follow a steady rhythm – both the Eminent Domain Act of 2025 and the Platform Accessibility Act (Amendment) are aimed at forming solutions for governmental inefficiencies. But we shouldn’t necessarily be surprised by this, as the Centre – and Pat in particular – have always held this theme as a main sticking point of their platforms.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    In addition to the aforementioned reform bills, Speaker Pat also introduced the Homeland Security Act – which codifies the Office of Homeland Security as an office under the Department of Justice. These three bills account for 23.1% of the total bills introduced in this senate session to date. It is clear that the poll’s respondents are pleased with Speaker Pat’s resilience, sharpness, and activity in the senate.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-bternarytau-ind-515-net-approval\">\n      Sen. BTernaryTau (Ind) – 51.5% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senatrix BTernaryTau (or “Tau”) is an Independent, and she is one of two Independent senators in the 134th Senate – the only one if you don’t count Senator FLY GUY. Senatrix Tau was elected with 6 first-place votes. Senatrix Tau is an experienced political player in SimDem. She has served the nation as President, an MP, and a ten-time Senatrix. As the final elimination in the 133rd Senate, it is no surprise that she has mustered enough support to be elected to the 134th.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Much of Tau’s legislative forte is in mathematics and political quantitative analysis. A salient example of this is their proposed and passed Threshold Equal Approval Voting Amendment. Tau has pursued passing this Amendment for multiple senate terms – even if she wasn’t a senator for some of them. This bill is Tau’s only proposed bill this Senate session to date, and, as such, the TEA Voting Amendment accounts for 7.7% of the total bills introduced in this senate session to date.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The poll’s respondents have obviously recognized Senatrix Tau’s experience and trust her judgment in the Senate. It is thus no surprise that she has the third-highest approval rating in the 134th Senate.&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-josephstalinxdxdxdxd-npp-499-net-approval\">\n      Sen. JosephStalinXDXDXDXD (NPP) – 49.9% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator JosephStalinXDXDXDXD (or “Stalin”) is a member of the New People’s Party, and he is one of two senators from the NPP in the 134th Senate. In the 133rd Senate, Stalin served as its speaker, facilitating the debate, amendments, and votes for over 30 bills. His approval ratings spiked during the middle of the 133rd Senate to 49.8%, and he remains stable in this poll – though I’m sure he won’t complain about the extra 0.1% bump up. Speaking of consistency, it is likely Stalin’s reliability in the Senate that allows him to enjoy such favorable net approval ratings. Stalin is an experienced member of SimDemocracy – having first been elected in the 18th Senate.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    \tStalin has been active in the 134th Senate as an avid yet open-minded debater. His two bills – the Senate Leadership and Committees Act and the Senate Rules and Procedures Act – both aim at providing redress for existing governmental inefficiencies. But it’s not necessarily the content of these bills that is interesting. It’s the level of debate that Stalin goes through in order to make them the most amenable to the public.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Throughout the debate periods for each bill, Stalin has listened to the concerns of Senators – only rebutting a claim if he thinks that there is indeed a better solution. It is this level of open-mindedness and willingness to debate on both his bills – which comprise 15.4% of the total bills introduced in this senate session to date – and other Senators’ bills which have conceivably allowed him to steadily carry his approval rating from the 133rd forward to today.&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-olive-lp-393-net-approval\">\n      Sen. Olive (LP) – 39.3% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator Olive is a member of the Lemon Party – a legacy and well-established party. That being said, it seems like Lemon put forward some fresh faces from the orchard, as both Olive and Thyme are relatively new to SimDem. Olive is a frequent contributor to debate, and their central policy focuses seem to revolve around economic and monetary policy. Given their newness to the Senate, it is likely that Senator Olive’s approval rating is largely in the honeymoon phase.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-thyme-lp-393-net-approval\">\n      Sen. Thyme (LP) – 39.3% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Like Senator Olive, Senator Thyme is also a Lemon Party member. To add onto both her and Olive’s similarities, they both have extremely similar net approval ratings. \n<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Thyme was elected after the CTSA-spurred certification of the 134th Senate election and – like Senator Olive – is likely still in a honeymoon approval phase, though possibly for different reasons. Thyme is an avid debater in all matters and questions every nominee or bill proposal. Even if she is a freshman Senator, she has made her mark in debate.&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-fly-guy-ind-327-net-approval\">\n      Sen. FLY GUY (Ind) – 32.7% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator FLY GUY originally ran for the 134th Senate as an independent but later joined the New People’s Party. For the purpose of current statistics, we have made statistical analyses below which classify him as both an Independent and a member of the New People’s Party.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator FLY GUY, like Thyme and Kelvin, was elected into the 134th Senate after the CTSA certification of the 134th Senate Election. Their main point of concern is the state of SimDem’s monetary policy, as evidenced by their sole bill proposal in this senate to date: the Central Banking Establishment Act. This bill comprises 7.7% of the total bills introduced in this senate session to date. It is probable that many respondents don’t know how to feel yet about FLY GUY – much like many of the freshman senators on this list.&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-notlukadebil-snp-154-net-approval\">\n      Sen. NotLukaDebiL (SNP) – 15.4% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator NotLukaDebiL (or “Luka”) is a member of the SimDem Nationalist Party, and it is his second Senate campaign – albeit his first successful one. Senator Luka has introduced two bills this senate session: the Job-Finder Act 2025 and the Repeal of the Marriage Law. While the JFA didn’t pass the Senate, the Repeal of the Marriage Act did with flying colors. Luka’s bills are based on good-intentioned ideals and tend to stem from the idea of creating equitable opportunities for all citizens of SimDem while eliminating problematic legislation from the equation.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Luka’s bills comprise 15.4% of the total bills introduced in this senate session to date – the exact same percentage as his net approval rating. If Luka’s approval ratings are indeed tied to the number of bills he introduces, then all he needs to increase his approval is to introduce more bills.&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-dovahkiin-spqr-86-net-approval\">\n      Sen. Dovahkiin (SPQR) – 8.6% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator Dovahkiin (or “Dovah”) is a member of Senatus Populusque Romanum – another legacy and well-established SimDem party. Senator Dovah has neither been particularly active in the 134th’s debates nor votes, and he has the fourth-lowest approval rating – making it curious as to how or why he was elected in the first place. However, Senator Dovah’s voting data may shine some light on this conundrum.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Dovah was elected with the second-most first-place votes – eight – but has the fourth-lowest approval rating. This indicates that he has a central group that favors his experience and supports him, but not many others necessarily approve of him. To reliably analyze and extrapolate more specifics as to Dovah’s approval trends, we will need to see more activity from him.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-noll-ind-07-net-approval\">\n      Sen. Noll (Ind) – -0.7% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator Noll is an independent senator, and he is the President of Voices of Democracy. He is a frequent contributor to Senate debates and has been a curious and avid learner. As the President of Voices of Democracy, it is likely that much of his disapproval ratings come from respondents who are unhappy with his affiliation with VoD. Like many Senate newcomers, we cannot accurately analyze Noll’s approval causes until we see more activity from and/or data on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-eleanor-qqq-175-net-approval\">\n      Sen. Eleanor (QQQ) – -17.5% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator Eleanor is a member of the Queer Queens Qlub, and she is an incumbent member of the 133rd Senate. Eleanor has not submitted any bills in this Senate session, but she has been an integral contributor to debate. It is likely that, despite this contribution, the respondents do not look favorably upon her given the recent controversial arrests and trials of QQQ members and affiliates DominaX, Kassady, Decatherinated, and NotCom.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-kelvin-fbp-335-net-approval\">\n      Sen. Kelvin (FBP) – -33.5% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator Kelvin is a member of the Fucking Best Party, and he is a long-time incumbent, as he has served the Senate continuously since before the Danyo Immigration Wave. What is curious, though, is how he was elected to the 134th Senate in the first place. What we know as of now is he was elected into the 134th Senate after the CTSA certification of the 134th Senate Election. Unlike Dovah, Senator Kelvin is active in Senate votes. However, much like Senator Dovah, he likely has a central group that favors his experience and supports him, but not many others necessarily approve of him.\n  </p>\n\n    <h4 id=\"lessugreaterparty-statisticslessugreater\">\n      <u>Party Statistics</u>\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    During this senate, thirteen bills have been introduced.

This proportion tracks partially because of the NPP’s Senate delegates. The political players within NPP – namely MyPenJustBroke and Stalin – are experienced bill writers with clear legislative preferences and goals.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"the-centrelessbrgreater\">\n      The Centre<br>\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    The Centre holds just 8.33% of the Senate seats – with Ppatpat being the sole delegate. However, the party is very similar to the NPP in that their bill proposal numbers punch above their weight. The Centre has proposed 23.1% of the bills introduced in this Senate session to date. Additionally, Ppatpat is another adept political player who is both versed in bill writing and Senate procedure.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"simdem-nationalist-party\">\n      SimDem Nationalist Party\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Like the Centre, SNP holds just 8.33% of the Senate seats, as Luka is the sole SNP delegate to the 134th. That being said, the SNP has proposed 15.4% of the bills in this Senate session to date. This points much more to Luka’s ability to recognize and write electorate-supported bills while also presenting platform-compliant legislation, as is seen by both of his proposals in this Senate.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"independents\">\n      Independents\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Independents hold between 8.33% and 16.66% of the Senate seats, but they have proposed between 7.7% and 15.4% of the bills introduced in this Senate to date. These statistics, no matter which party you assign FLY GUY to, suggest that independents are toeing the line with specific single-issue bills which match their personal platforms – as is further evidenced by Tau’s sole introduction of the TEA Voting Amendment.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"independent-voter-leanings\">\n      Independent Voter Leanings\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Of the 37 poll respondents, seven of those respondents – or 18.92% – self-identify as independent voters. In order to better understand where these independent voters lie ideologically, we asked them to select a party that they most identify with, if there was any.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n<div><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/21576684\"><script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"></script><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21576684/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"chart visualization\"  data-is-external-image=\"true\"></noscript></div>\n</div>\n\n  <p>\n    Three of the seven – or 42.9% – independent respondents responded that they lean the most towards the New People’s Party.

Another one respondent identified with the Centre, and the last two respondents – or 28.6% – did not lean towards any party in particular.<br>\n  </p>\n<div><h4>Share article:</h4>\n<center>\n<button onclick=\"copyURL()\">Copy link</button>\n<script>\nfunction copyURL() {\n let url = document.location.href\nnavigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(function() {\n    console.log('Copied!');\n}, function() {\n    console.log('Copy error')\n});\n}\n</script>\n</center>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.commoninja.com/sdk/latest/commonninja.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"commonninja_component pid-bce4f8ea-9bd1-4793-88bc-63467f850c33\"></div>\n<script>\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {\n    const elements = document.querySelectorAll('.flourish-credit');\n    elements.forEach(element => {\n    element.remove();\n    })\n});\n</script>\n</div>",

Although a cursory glance may not raise any eyebrows (after all, both are extremely experienced, having served at all levels of government in years past), the ticket, and the election at large, brought to light a series of serious issues. In looking deeper into the issue, I aim to answer two questions: Was this inevitable? And where do we go from here?\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Just two and a half weeks ago, the Call for Candidates (CFC) for the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SimDemocracy/comments/1id4lt3/134th_senatorial_election_call_for_candidates/\"  class=\"extlink extlink-icon-1\"  >134th Presidential Election</a> was opened, closing with 22 candidates to be placed on the ballot. Two weeks later, the<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SimDemocracy/comments/1iiiybf/135th_presidential_election_call_for_candidates/\"  class=\"extlink extlink-icon-1\"  > CFC for this week's election</a> closed with half as many. Of the 11 candidates, if we exclude explicit joke candidates (such as those campaigning solely on banning the letter E or an item of clothing), those ineligible to run due to being banned, and perennial candidates (sorry Sam), we're left with only 5 candidates.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Two of them were independents who had zero support and weren't even in the Discord server (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SimDemocracy/comments/1iiiybf/comment/mbf80hy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\"  class=\"extlink extlink-icon-1\"  >one of them</a> even falsely claimed that former Senator Muggy was part of their non-existent party). When it comes down to it, there were only 3 candidates that had any chance; therein lies the most concerning part of this election cycle:\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>All three candidates were essentially a front for the incumbent administration.</b>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Recall that the outgoing administration consisted of Imade as president and Tripod as vice president. Despite Imade indicating that they would seek to leave politics after a second term and providing tacit support for an announced Tripod-Creative ticket in an interview at the beginning of their second term, that clearly did not pan out.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Tripod continued to run, of course, but with Creative heading his own ticket, Tripod was resigned to running on the platform of continuing the work of the front-running VP candidate while claiming that her VP would be the front-running presidential candidate. That's certainly not an enviable position.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Lastly, there was Bakob, a USL member like Imade who had a single campaign promise: he named Imade as his VP and vowed, if elected, to resign immediately so Imade could serve a third term. The craziest part? Bakob actually moved on to the runoff stage against the Creative-Imade ticket.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>To be clear, this means that the competition in the runoff was to determine whether Imade would serve a third term as president or be Creative's VP in an administration that aimed to continue and expand Imade's reforms.&nbsp;</b>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Regardless of one's views on the previous administration, it is clear that this election was a distraction—Imade would remain at the highest level of government for another two weeks and their ideas would continue to guide the executive no matter who won. There was <i>never</i> any doubt.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    There was no viable competition; how could there be? At the core of this issue is The Liberty Coalition (TLC), a coalition of the Lemon Party (LP), New People's Party (NPP), United Socialist League (USL), and the Centre (C). This coalition, based solely on <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/554769523635650580/1028627919993585745/1338044307201986590\"  class=\"extlink extlink-icon-1\"  >role numbers</a>, makes up nearly 60% of all party-affiliated members and has even more weight to throw around when considering the relative inactivity of SPQR and the legal sanctions on most of the QQQ&nbsp;(the only other major parties). They also make up half of the current Senate, whereas the remaining senators are largely either independent or unpopular with most of the electorate.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The numbers don't lie: without some sort of breakage within TLC, there is no viable opposition.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Defenders of the current arrangement have argued that this is democracy in action. \"The Creative-Imade campaign won in a landslide, so people clearly wanted this. There's no conspiracy.\"\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    To that, I say: <br>People supported the winning ticket in droves, sure, but there was already no viable opposition to their campaign by the time the election rolled around. With most of the major parties backing a single ticket and even a field of candidates whose sole goal was to keep Imade in power, there was only the illusion of choice.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    As for a conspiracy, I don't believe that TLC's goal is a shadow government that rigs elections in their favor. My reason for including the Carlin quote at the start was to highlight a similar sentiment. In Senate elections, there are many winners since there are many seats to go around; coalitions for those elections are largely proposals for governing coalitions should each party gain the numbers they need.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    In presidential elections, however, there can only be one winner; coalitions here are far less strictly ideological and more strategic. To that end, each party in TLC saw the coalition as beneficial and the Creative-Imade ticket as at least \"good enough,\" so the plan was set. In fact, I'd argue that as soon as any two of the four parties joined forces, the decision to either join in or form an opposing coalition became necessary in order for any other party to guarantee a chance that their voice would be heard in the new administration.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>So was this inevitable? Under our current laws, yes.</b>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    To prevent another coalition like this directly would be illegal due to constitutional protections for freedom of speech and association. However, there is at least a way to prevent triple-term (and longer) administrations: term limits.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The idea is highly controversial and was especially so in the earlier days of SimDem where the same 30 or so people were expected to fill 10 executive positions, a sizable Senate, a Supreme Court and lower court seats, and make up a voting populace. In such a situation, restrictions on who could serve where and when were impractical.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Since then, our community has grown massively and there are a number of members looking for government or private jobs. We have an abundance of people who have passed the bar (all ten versions of it). There is no need to worry about whether jobs or positions can be filled; the greatest threats now are corruption and complacency.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Even if a dictator (used here very loosely to highlight the extended rule of a single person/group) is popularly elected, the power that they have over the government and the length of their rule makes those two dangers easy to come by. In this case, it is the soft power of the ruling TLC and its satellite members that makes those threats real.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    For those reasons, I argue that <b>a limit of two consecutive terms should be placed on the presidency</b> and that anyone who serves those two terms must then <b>wait an additional two terms before running again.</b> This still gives each administration up to a month to make the changes they wish to see a reality while giving other candidates (even if within the same party) a shot at the highest office. Of course, in another month, they could run again and even win if there is enough demand, but this should at least prevent complacency at the executive level.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    You may note that this proposal alone would not have stopped Imade from serving as Creative's VP after two terms, thereby not resolving the primary issue. That's why I also propose that, much like in the United States, <b>anyone who is ineligible to be President should not be able to run for Vice President.</b> This change, in conjunction with the first, should make it far more difficult for a single person or group to control SimDem politics for an extended period.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    These changes may be difficult to implement, needing a constitutional amendment to guarantee their effectiveness, but that is no reason not to push for it. I welcome debate on the finer points of the plan and hope to find a solution that is amenable to all, but above all, we must put the sanctity of the free vote (and of democracy) first.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>Break free from the illusion of choice and push the Senate to make change now.</b>\n  </p>\n<div><h4>Share article:</h4>\n<center>\n<button onclick=\"copyURL()\">Copy link</button>\n<script>\nfunction copyURL() {\n let url = document.location.href\nnavigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(function() {\n    console.log('Copied!');\n}, function() {\n    console.log('Copy error')\n});\n}\n</script>\n</center>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.commoninja.com/sdk/latest/commonninja.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"commonninja_component pid-bce4f8ea-9bd1-4793-88bc-63467f850c33\"></div></div>",

We cannot build a functioning economy if everyone has a completely different view of how that economy should operate at the fundamental level. While I openly identify myself on the left, clear by my former leadership of the LUF and activity within the SDPB before my resignation, I feel it is fundamental to make the economy an area of bipartisan agreement to ensure the best outcome, not strained by controversy.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    A few days before Imade’s election, more than two weeks ago, I was privately confirmed as the SDPB’s pick for Secretary of the Treasury. Almost immediately, I researched everything that I could find, discovering there was only a single valid law on the economy, the very one that established the role I had been nominated for and the Tau as a currency. From there, it didn’t take me long to work out what really needed to change. I and my co-writer, former LUF member Jimmy Fallon, began work on a lengthy plan; the framework of this economic dossier was later redrafted and adopted as the key consensus for Imade’s administration. This was all based on three missions:\n  </p>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>Increasing Employment</li><li>Creation of New Businesses</li><li>Increasing Economic Activity of Citizens\n</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <p>\n    Once we had assembled the dossier and come up with several policies to achieve those aims, we were quickly halted by the slow-moving and often criticised 132nd Senate, the last to feature such a small count of senators holding the entire executive branch back from being able to work. The cabinet wasn’t confirmed in their positions for nearly an entire week, half of the entire term. By the time that I and my colleagues were confirmed, I was quickly thrown into utter shock.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Most new governments complain about their inheritance and how the books aren’t balanced or the general state of things. However, when I got into the backend of the Treasury, I quickly discovered that there was no inheritance. At all. All the businesses and all the spending that the government had conducted for months were being entirely unaccounted for. We quite simply had no records. This is not only a disgrace for the former administration but it left me and the other workers within the Treasury to spend countless hours making spreadsheets, tracking down data, and registering every single business into proper government files.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    On top of this, I became ill the next week and I simply didn’t have time to fulfill the demanding role of creating and keeping spreadsheets up to date, registering new business accounts, handing out government stipends, and also fulfilling our full economic plan (which we released around that time). So, I resigned in an attempt to get out of the way and allow Imade to push forward with the agenda; sadly, this move hasn’t been as effective as I'd thought.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Moving forward now, with a new Treasury Secretary who I can personally vouch for as a very engaged and effective aide within the Treasury, work needs to be done. However, this work can not come from Imade’s cabinet alone: the Senate needs to get on board and work directly with them to author legislation on many of the proposals in the consensus.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    For example, an independent central bank would be massively beneficial if set up correctly and headed by the right people. The power of printing currency and official loans would be much better handled by an organisation built to do so and not government officials that come and go often. How can money be effectively managed when, theoretically, a new administration could come into power every two weeks? Some of this power needs to be transferred away into a new independent body to bring activity into the economy.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The system needs to be easier as well; the threads to claim government stipends and create businesses are hidden away, and people need to be encouraged to go beyond just forming a special bank account and creating businesses. This is effectively deregulation of the discord server, but it isn’t some nutty new-right style of letting the markets run free. Rather, it's a managed jump start of the service-based economy we're running.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The people need to want to engage with the economy, and to do this we need to make sure people know how it actually works. That is why I introduced the economic noticeboard as a basic tutorial of the system, but that isn’t enough alone.<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    We must go further and I believe, under Imade’s presidency and with hard-working senators, we can achieve the change we need.<br>\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--long-line\" />\n<div><h4>Share article:</h4>\n<center>\n<button onclick=\"copyURL()\">Copy link</button>\n<script>\nfunction copyURL() {\n let url = document.location.href\nnavigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(function() {\n    console.log('Copied!');\n}, function() {\n    console.log('Copy error')\n});\n}\n</script>\n</center>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.commoninja.com/sdk/latest/commonninja.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"commonninja_component pid-bce4f8ea-9bd1-4793-88bc-63467f850c33\"></div>\n</div>",

I'm not ruling out running again in the coming weeks or months, but I will likely be bowing out at least temporarily at the end of this term, and if I do do that then Tripod would be my chosen successor.&nbsp;🫡\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"vp-tripodandnbsphas-creative-already-agreed-to-be-your-vp-or-is-this-still-in-the-planning-stage\" class=\"align-center\">\n      VP Tripod,&nbsp;has Creative already agreed to be your VP or is this still in the planning stage?\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    Creative has agreed to be my running mate in the next election.<br>I think he would be a great guy to run with given our past history of working together.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--long-line\" />\n<div><h4>Share article:</h4>\n<center>\n<button onclick=\"copyURL()\">Copy link</button>\n<script>\nfunction copyURL() {\n let url = document.location.href\nnavigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(function() {\n    console.log('Copied!');\n}, function() {\n    console.log('Copy error')\n});\n}\n</script>\n</center>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.commoninja.com/sdk/latest/commonninja.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"commonninja_component pid-bce4f8ea-9bd1-4793-88bc-63467f850c33\"></div>\n</div>",
