In the realm of law, navigating that boundary is left to judges, who are admired and promoted for their prowess in understanding and interpreting legislation.<br><br>We trust judges to rely on precedent in most cases, only overturning egregious miscarriages of justice that are often the result of nearsightedness or partisanship. In the ruling of \"In re Appeal of Summary Ban - \"mc_uighilin\" (u/Panzzrr) [2025] SDSC2\" (hereafter \"the Panzzrr case\"), the Supreme Court has overturned a fundamental precedent that has kept SimDemocracy alive as long as it has: the supremacy of the relevant platform's Terms of Service.<br><br>This flawed judgment, made in the name of protecting due process, opens the door for abuse and the death of SimDemocracy.<br><br>Not long ago, the SimDem community celebrated its sixth anniversary—this year's festivities were marked by the massive increase in the citizen population that occurred just a month prior due to the viral video posted by longtime member Danyo (Trolligarch). Then and since, many of the \"older generation\" (i.e. those who were citizens before the most recent immigration wave) noted that SimDem in earlier years was far more permissive of toxic behavior and harassment.<br><br>Some members, such as Toast, look fondly upon that era, but the vast majority of citizens are at least content with the protections in place to prevent that conduct, if not interested in strengthening them. Additionally, the Discord Terms of Service (and, by extension, Community Guidelines) have been strengthened in recent years to prevent harmful conduct such as harassment of marginalized groups, the proliferation of CSAM and misinformation, and hate speech in the form of genocide denial. <br><br>The tools used and care taken on behalf of Discord have improved over the years as it has faced more scrutiny and the \"nuking\" (the complete removal of a server, up to and including the banning of its members) of hateful or otherwise harmful servers is something I've seen only increase in that same period. <br><br>The Supreme Court ruling in the Panzzrr case opens our beloved community up to that same fate.<br><br>In SimDem's history, there have been no small number of people banned under the Discord Terms of Service; many for hate speech in all its forms, but others for issues far more serious—and illegal. I need not elaborate on the specific details of those cases to spare any reader the time and disgust, but the proper course of action is clear: a ban. A final, permanent ban.<br><br>As much as we want to believe that we are a government or nation-state, we are not. We cannot make decisions on cases that risk our place on the platform or lead to criminal records. At a certain point, we must admit that there are \"SimDem crimes\" too serious to permit by allowing the offender to stay on the server for a trial, or even to keep in contact with.<br><br>Every judge, besides those ruling in this case, was well aware of that fact—nay, common sense.<br><br>However, this group of three (themselves not without controversy) have not only rebuked that approach but applied the ruling retroactively. Hundreds of the most vile people to ever \"step foot\" in SimDem are now, according to the Court, constitutionally guaranteed the right to return.<br><br>There has never, in my estimation and that of esteemed citizens far more knowledgeable than I, been a Supreme Court ruling so dangerous or detrimental to our community than this.<br><br>Multiple prominent members, including Danyo himself, who brought so many of us back or introduced us to SimDem for the first time, have already indicated that they no longer wish to remain in the server given the risk of its \"nuking.\" I cannot blame them.<br><br>In fact, although I've had my issues with the server in the past, I (like so many others) have always felt drawn to the community for one reason or another. There has never been a more compelling reason to leave.<br><br>I will not take this space to encourage people to leave immediately, however; instead, I encourage anyone who has read thus far to take action. Push the Senate to pass legislation immediately to overturn the ruling and hold the Supreme Court justices accountable for what is, at its best, a complete lack of foresight and sound judgment.<br><br>If all else fails, then leaving is indeed the only choice left, if only to protect your account.<br><br>Our democracy has not yet died; do not let this opportunity to save it slip away.\n  </p>\n<div><h4>Share article:</h4>\n<center>\n<button onclick=\"copyURL()\">Copy link</button>\n<script>\nfunction copyURL() {\n let url = document.location.href\nnavigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(function() {\n    console.log('Copied!');\n}, function() {\n    console.log('Copy error')\n});\n}\n</script>\n</center>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.commoninja.com/sdk/latest/commonninja.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"commonninja_component pid-bce4f8ea-9bd1-4793-88bc-63467f850c33\"></div>\n</div>",

The SDSE (SimDemocracy Stock Exchange) is an independent project where entrepreneurs and investors can trade public business stocks.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The SDSE was created during a time when the economy was stagnant, lacking the mobility and monetary flux that stable economies rely on, as per the words of u/frisianoutlaw – a major investor and founder of the SDSE.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    With few outlets for spending available, people turned to entrepreneurship and high-risk ventures like gambling, but for those seeking structured, long-term investment opportunities, SDSE provided a new, organized alternative&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The economy is always shifting, reflecting the constant change of power in government leadership and workforce. While new taxation policies have been introduced to stabilize revenue streams, the SDSE remains largely untouched by regulatory oversight. The question now is whether the SDSE can prove itself to become an essential pillar of the economy, or will remain a side project hindered by the various fiscal problems our democracy faces—a question I hope to answer by the end of this article.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    A major detail I pointedly did not mention earlier in my explanation of the SDSE is that the SDSE has, as of the writing of this article, no government regulations imposed on it. Unlike other sources of revenue, which are subject to taxation, such as wages and personal income—the SDSE remains untouched by government oversight.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This regulatory gap is significant because, while taxation and oversight can provide stability, they also introduce friction that discourages investment. SDSE’s current freedom from government intervention gives it a special opportunity to grow dynamically; provided it can gain the public’s trust.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Moreover, this also raises questions about the SDSE’s long-term role in the economy. To explore this point further, let’s consider both the opinions of investors and the insight of the government through its financial policies.\n  </p>\n<div><hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr>\n<center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center>\n<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\" alt=\"\" class=\"ad\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr></div>\n\n  <p>\n    You might believe that the SDSE is too young and undeveloped to rely on or even pursue in terms of financial reserves, but in the eyes of many investors: the SDSE is growing sustainably. Every week, stocks are exchanged and new businesses are listed to the public. This is NOT a call for you to go spend your life savings on stocks; far from it actually, as the stock exchange is misunderstood by many and underplayed.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Nf19_1, a lawyer and investor whom I interviewed for his broad knowledge of the market, believes that the stock exchange is perceived by many as a game of fate. Buy low, sell high—just like the roll of dice; however, Nf19_1 argues that the market follows patterns that need to be analyzed and leveraged. Nf19_1 is also one of the few that recognize the real obstacle that faces the SDSE: financial engagement is not yet an essential part of life.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Stock investments rely on confidence – that is a fact known by many. Where brokers like Nf19_1 identify profitable opportunities in companies like SimDem Today and GatoPoll, other people remain dormant. The lack of public interest in finance means that SDSE’s influence is of limited reach.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    And why is that a problem per se? Without active engagement, the market risks stagnation. This economic stagnation will not only be a failure of the SDSE itself but rather a sign that financial literacy and economic participation must be encouraged.  This is the problem that started the SDSE in the first place and the reason why I stated that it may persist. The challenge, the main obstacle that lies in front, is to connect those who see the value of the SDSE and those who do not.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    What is the role of the government in this? The government’s economic strategy indirectly supports SDSE’s growth by focusing on stability and self-actualization. Recently, the Senate introduced the Government Bond Expansion Act. To spare you the technical details, which you can obtain by reading the Act, this legislation defines the various forms of government bonds provided. By giving the Treasury the ability to issue the different types of bonds at need, this act births a new avenue for investment.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    And how does the SDSE relate to bond expansion? Well, a bond market could integrate seamlessly with the stock exchange. Bonds and stocks are different at their core and they serve different purposes but they provide complementary roles. Bonds provide economic stability, while stocks drive growth.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Markets with both stocks and bonds tend to have more mature economies. For example, in the real world, you have the U.S. Treasury and Wall Street, the London Stock Exchange, and government gilts. Many examples worldwide can prove and assert that bonds and stocks coexisting can enhance a country’s financial stability.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    One might argue that what differentiates us from the examples I gave above is that, in the real world, there is a need for money—there is a desire to obtain money on a large scale that is not present in a simulation. However, that assumption overlooks a crucial factor: the role of structured financial systems in shaping economic behavior.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Even in a simulation of a democracy, where basic survival does not hinge on wealth, incentives, or competition – investment still drives economic activity. The absence of necessity does not eliminate the demand for a stock exchange, it merely transforms it shifting the focus from survival, or what you can perceive as survival, to influence, growth, and financial incentive.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    But is the economy really in such dire need of the stock exchange? To be more clear—how is the economy performing? Is the government able to control and manage its finances in a self-sufficient and efficient manner?\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/kuguk.png\" height=\"530\" width=\"912\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/responsive/kuguk-xs.png 640w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/responsive/kuguk-sm.png 768w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/responsive/kuguk-md.png 1024w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/responsive/kuguk-lg.png 1366w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/responsive/kuguk-xl.png 1600w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/responsive/kuguk-2xl.png 1920w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    If we were to describe the data above, it would be clear that the government's accounts are fluctuant in their current state. January saw significant income outweighing spending, but by February the government’s expenses had skyrocketed. March, though incomplete in records, suggests a sharp decline in income revenue.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The structural weaknesses present in the Treasury have been highlighted by both Secretary of Treasury Matt Cheney, and his predecessor, FLY GUY 215, who voiced his thoughts and experiences in a similar article here. The focus of the Treasury at the current time is to lay out the foundation upon which to develop the economy, which is why the SDSE has been left fairly unregulated for the time being.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This may perhaps lead to your question: how can the government integrate the SDSE into the current economic infrastructure? Should the SDSE be regulated? Taxed? Subsidized? Well, not exactly.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    You see, many investors and shareholders—including Loger, founding member of ROSE and major investor of GatoPoll who I interviewed for the research of this article, share a common sentiment in that taxing the stock exchange would lead to negative behavior from investors and may as a consequence halt trading all-together. Loger also believes that there is no need for legislation amidst the current volume of trade.\n  </p>\n<div><hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr>\n<center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center>\n<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\" alt=\"\" class=\"ad\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr></div>\n\n  <p>\n    This raises a significant question: how can the government integrate SDSE into the economy without stifling its growth? The point I’m trying to make is that the investors, like Logan, believe that a poorly implemented or restrictive implementation of legislations and policies is destructive to the stock exchange and the fall of the stock exchange may attribute a large loss in circulation and monetary flow for the economy as a whole.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The Treasury acknowledges the importance of tax reforms and legislation, but insists that they must be based on thorough research and long-term data rather than rushed policies. Implementing policies in a haste would not only cause public distress but also damage the already fragile economic infrastructure currently present.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Secretary of Treasury Matt Cheney has emphasized in an interview that I conducted with him that he will not be making a decision in regards to regulating the SDSE without solid concrete evidence and data that suggests otherwise, stating:\n  </p>\n\n    <blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n      “People will always say that something that affects their bottom line will be bad, but you have to weigh that against how much it could help the economy and real data detailing how it would affect investors. I completely understand why people would have that concern but until there’s evidence that is the case I am not going to make a decision on it either way.”&nbsp;<br>\n    </blockquote>\n\n  <p>\n    The future of the SDSE remains unwritten, but one thing is crystal clear—it is no longer a side project or an isolated financial experiment. It has become a force within the economy, a system that channels capital, drives investment, and provides opportunities where none existed before.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Only time will tell how our economy will evolve—but one thing is certain: the SDSE plays a crucial role in its growth. The question is no longer whether the SDSE is relevant but how best to harness its potential without stifling its growth. And in that regard, the SDSE has already succeeded—it is no longer a matter of how it will shape the economy, but more so a matter of how far it will go.\n  </p>\n<div><h4>Share article:</h4>\n<center>\n<button onclick=\"copyURL()\">Copy link</button>\n<script>\nfunction copyURL() {\n let url = document.location.href\nnavigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(function() {\n    console.log('Copied!');\n}, function() {\n    console.log('Copy error')\n});\n}\n</script>\n</center>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.commoninja.com/sdk/latest/commonninja.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"commonninja_component pid-bce4f8ea-9bd1-4793-88bc-63467f850c33\"></div></div>",

They had the idea to create the party actually but wanted me to be the figurehead.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>You joined the SimDem server and near-immediately made a lengthy post about ROSE and QQQ. Since you're so new but commenting on old drama, many have accused you of being an alt. What is your official comment on those accusations?&nbsp;</b><br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I joined this server with one goal, to call out ROSE and their long history of wrecking SimDemocracy. The fact that some are scrambling to label me an \"alt\" instead of addressing what I’m saying only proves how desperate they are to dodge the truth. I’ve done my research and I’ve talked to the people who lived through the chaos the QQQ caused, and I’m not here to play along with their revisionist history. If my presence shakes them, maybe they should take a hard look at why.\n<br>\n\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Let's get something straight. I’m far from the only one who sees through ROSE’s lies. Plenty of long-time SimDemocracy members have been harassed, sabotaged, and targeted by these same people, and now ROSE wants everyone to forget about it. We will not allow this to happen. These people spent days attacking anyone who stood in their way, and now they want to hide behind another shell party for their failure of the original. But no matter how much they try to deflect, they don’t get to erase what they’ve done. We will not allow them to erase what they have done.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>ROSE have defended themselves by noting that the QQQ members with a history of slur usage and/or harassment (ex. Domina, Kassady, etc.) are not in ROSE and, in fact, no longer in the server. Given this, why is the TVDP continuing its attacks on ROSE?</b>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    ROSE can claim they’ve cut ties with QQQ’s worst offenders, but their actions tell a different story. They still harbor figures like Decatherinated/High Show. Harboring isn't even the right word since they basically lead the party. They've caused direct harm to TVDP members and perhaps did not participate in the same slur usage as other members but vehemently defended those who did. If they truly wanted a fresh start, they wouldn’t keep those who embody the same toxicity they claim to reject. The TVDP isn’t attacking ROSE, we’re holding them accountable for their hypocrisy and ongoing attempts to undermine order in SimDemocracy.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>To clarify, are you asserting that Decatherinated and High Show are the same person or simply both are leading the party?</b>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Same person.\n  </p>\n<div><hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr>\n<center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center>\n<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\" alt=\"\" class=\"ad\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr></div>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>What is your evidence for that accusation?</b>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This is technically circumstantial evidence, but the timing and sequence of events raise serious suspicions. Given the close range of server join dates between Decautherinated [<i>sic</i>]&nbsp;and High Show, we believe there is a strong likelihood that High Show is, in fact, an alternate account created to bypass the consequences of Decautherinated’s  [<i>sic</i>] actions.\n<br>\n<br>Decautherinated [<i>sic</i>] was fully aware of the illegality of her future actions days before committing them, which ultimately led to her arrest. The sudden appearance of High Show, closely following these events, suggests an intentional effort to evade the judicial system and continue participation in SimDem under a different identity. The behavioral patterns, engagement style, and political involvement of High Show align too closely with those of Decautherinated [<i>sic</i>] for this to be dismissed as mere coincidence.\n<br>\n<br>Given these factors, we strongly suspect that High Show is an alt account created to allow Decautherinated [<i>sic</i>] to re-enter SimDem’s political sphere despite her ban. This represents not only a subversion of justice but a deliberate attempt to manipulate the system while avoiding accountability.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--long-line\" />\n<pre class=\" language-html\"><code>We reached out to Blanche (High Show) and Decatherinated for comment on these allegations. They simultaneously refuted \"this nonsense in the strongest terms\" and highlighted their transparency, while noting that Decatherinated has been in the server as early as 2022 and is, in fact, not banned.\n\nIn addition, they requested that the following images be offered for confirmation of that fact with attached captions for context.\n\nThe interview continues below the images.</code></pre>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/image.png\" height=\"79\" width=\"913\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/image-xs.png 640w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/image-sm.png 768w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/image-md.png 1024w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/image-lg.png 1366w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/image-xl.png 1600w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/image-2xl.png 1920w\">\n      <figcaption>Both responded to our questions simultaneously.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172005-2.png\" height=\"250\" width=\"569\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172005-2-xs.png 640w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172005-2-sm.png 768w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172005-2-md.png 1024w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172005-2-lg.png 1366w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172005-2-xl.png 1600w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172005-2-2xl.png 1920w\">\n      <figcaption>Blanche (High Show) participating in another server before Decatherinated's account was even created, with a forwarded message as proof.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172110.png\" height=\"427\" width=\"232\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172110-xs.png 640w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172110-sm.png 768w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172110-md.png 1024w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172110-lg.png 1366w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172110-xl.png 1600w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172110-2xl.png 1920w\">\n      <figcaption>Decatherinated's profile, with the date of her account creation in March 2022 highlighted.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/aefwef.png\" height=\"768\" width=\"1229\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/aefwef-xs.png 640w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/aefwef-sm.png 768w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/aefwef-md.png 1024w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/aefwef-lg.png 1366w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/aefwef-xl.png 1600w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/aefwef-2xl.png 1920w\">\n      <figcaption>An (admittedly inebriated) Decatherinated insisted this image from April 2022 showing her custom Hearthstone card designs in another server be included.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--long-line\" />\n\n  <p>\n    <b>You've also overseen the construction of a list of enemies or \"adversaries\" outside of those in ROSE.

These three Senators ended up running as incumbents for the 134th Senate and retained their seats – some in a more straightforward manner than others.\n<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The only other two incumbent senators who were re-elected are Ppatpat and MyPenJustBroke. These two’s approval trends followed the pack of the other ten senators, as we believe that the Senators exited the honeymoon period – which is colloquially defined as the short period of heightened approval ratings experienced by a person in the beginning periods of their tenure.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    It should be noted, though, that while these two Senators did follow the mid-maxxing approval trend, both MyPen and Ppatpat had the most #1 votes of all of the incumbent senators. This suggests that both senators have strong intra-party and inter-party support, allowing them to continue their legislative work.&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h4 id=\"lessugreaterthe-senators-a-mixed-analysislessugreater\">\n      <u>The Senators (A Mixed Analysis)</u>\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    After the CTSA drama ousted former PUP member zhennyzhenzhen, among others, and brought in FLY GUY, Thyme, and Kelvin, we have been able to conduct an approval poll and report our results here. In addition to reporting the raw “Net Approval” statistic, we will also provide you with our analysis as to why we believe each Senator has achieved their approval level.\n<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    A note for the reader before we get started: Senator FLY GUY’s switch from an independent candidate to the New People’s Party after the 134th Senate Election left many asking where he should be sorted. So, as an amazing example of compromise in the democratic process, I unilaterally decided to include charts and rankings that outline the bill proposals which account for FLY GUY being both an Independent and an NPP Senator.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n<div><hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr>\n<center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center>\n<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\" alt=\"\" class=\"ad\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr></div>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-mypenjustbroke-npp-735-net-approval\">\n      Sen. MyPenJustBroke (NPP) – 73.5% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator MyPenJustBroke (or “MyPen”) is the Chief Policy Director of the New People’s Party, and he is one of two senators from the NPP in the 134th Senate – one of three if you count Senator FLY GUY. Senator MyPen was elected for the second time with the most first-place votes, amounting to 13 votes. Senator MyPen has the highest approval rating for both 133rd Senate incumbents and for the 134th Senate.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    One of the most striking aspects of Senator MyPen’s tenure is his volume of legislative output. He has introduced four bills this session, accounting for 30.8% of all proposed legislation. His proposals cover a wide range of issues, demonstrating a strategic appeal to different voter bases. Voters tend to gravitate toward candidates who are effective policymakers, and MyPen’s productivity and legislative ambition make him stand out as someone who is not just present but actively shaping the direction of governance.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    \tMyPen’s policy initiatives are not overtly partisan - they often address both economic fairness and governmental efficiency. His popularity appears to stem from an innate ability to appeal across party lines by addressing issues and being the one to form consensus on solutions. He has a high volume of legislation and debate, but doesn’t alienate moderate or conservative voters while doing so.&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-ppatpat-c-698-net-approvallessbrgreater\">\n      Sen. Ppatpat (C) – 69.8% Net Approval<br>\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator Ppatpat (or “Pat”) is the leader of the Centre, and the only senator from the Centre in the 134th Senate. The Centre delegate held the third-most first-place votes in the 134th Senate Election, with seven under his belt. Immediately after his election, he campaigned and won the 134th Speaker election. Speaker Pat was undoubtedly thrown into interesting times in the first few days of his speakership.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    For one, he was forced to invalidate all nominations and legislative votes after the DoJ’s use of the CTSA forced the Senate into limbo. After the final certification of the votes pulled four senator-hopefuls out of the 134th and brought three (mostly) fresh faces in, Speaker Pat reintroduced the votes and expediently went about Senate business. Most recently, Speaker Pat facilitated the Senate’s passage of the current State of Caution, enacted in response to the PUP’s recent threats and incursions against SimDemocracy private party and organizational servers.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Speaker Pat’s introduced bills follow a steady rhythm – both the Eminent Domain Act of 2025 and the Platform Accessibility Act (Amendment) are aimed at forming solutions for governmental inefficiencies. But we shouldn’t necessarily be surprised by this, as the Centre – and Pat in particular – have always held this theme as a main sticking point of their platforms.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    In addition to the aforementioned reform bills, Speaker Pat also introduced the Homeland Security Act – which codifies the Office of Homeland Security as an office under the Department of Justice. These three bills account for 23.1% of the total bills introduced in this senate session to date. It is clear that the poll’s respondents are pleased with Speaker Pat’s resilience, sharpness, and activity in the senate.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-bternarytau-ind-515-net-approval\">\n      Sen. BTernaryTau (Ind) – 51.5% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senatrix BTernaryTau (or “Tau”) is an Independent, and she is one of two Independent senators in the 134th Senate – the only one if you don’t count Senator FLY GUY. Senatrix Tau was elected with 6 first-place votes. Senatrix Tau is an experienced political player in SimDem. She has served the nation as President, an MP, and a ten-time Senatrix. As the final elimination in the 133rd Senate, it is no surprise that she has mustered enough support to be elected to the 134th.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Much of Tau’s legislative forte is in mathematics and political quantitative analysis. A salient example of this is their proposed and passed Threshold Equal Approval Voting Amendment. Tau has pursued passing this Amendment for multiple senate terms – even if she wasn’t a senator for some of them. This bill is Tau’s only proposed bill this Senate session to date, and, as such, the TEA Voting Amendment accounts for 7.7% of the total bills introduced in this senate session to date.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The poll’s respondents have obviously recognized Senatrix Tau’s experience and trust her judgment in the Senate. It is thus no surprise that she has the third-highest approval rating in the 134th Senate.&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-josephstalinxdxdxdxd-npp-499-net-approval\">\n      Sen. JosephStalinXDXDXDXD (NPP) – 49.9% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator JosephStalinXDXDXDXD (or “Stalin”) is a member of the New People’s Party, and he is one of two senators from the NPP in the 134th Senate. In the 133rd Senate, Stalin served as its speaker, facilitating the debate, amendments, and votes for over 30 bills. His approval ratings spiked during the middle of the 133rd Senate to 49.8%, and he remains stable in this poll – though I’m sure he won’t complain about the extra 0.1% bump up. Speaking of consistency, it is likely Stalin’s reliability in the Senate that allows him to enjoy such favorable net approval ratings. Stalin is an experienced member of SimDemocracy – having first been elected in the 18th Senate.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    \tStalin has been active in the 134th Senate as an avid yet open-minded debater. His two bills – the Senate Leadership and Committees Act and the Senate Rules and Procedures Act – both aim at providing redress for existing governmental inefficiencies. But it’s not necessarily the content of these bills that is interesting. It’s the level of debate that Stalin goes through in order to make them the most amenable to the public.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Throughout the debate periods for each bill, Stalin has listened to the concerns of Senators – only rebutting a claim if he thinks that there is indeed a better solution. It is this level of open-mindedness and willingness to debate on both his bills – which comprise 15.4% of the total bills introduced in this senate session to date – and other Senators’ bills which have conceivably allowed him to steadily carry his approval rating from the 133rd forward to today.&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-olive-lp-393-net-approval\">\n      Sen. Olive (LP) – 39.3% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator Olive is a member of the Lemon Party – a legacy and well-established party. That being said, it seems like Lemon put forward some fresh faces from the orchard, as both Olive and Thyme are relatively new to SimDem. Olive is a frequent contributor to debate, and their central policy focuses seem to revolve around economic and monetary policy. Given their newness to the Senate, it is likely that Senator Olive’s approval rating is largely in the honeymoon phase.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-thyme-lp-393-net-approval\">\n      Sen. Thyme (LP) – 39.3% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Like Senator Olive, Senator Thyme is also a Lemon Party member. To add onto both her and Olive’s similarities, they both have extremely similar net approval ratings. \n<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Thyme was elected after the CTSA-spurred certification of the 134th Senate election and – like Senator Olive – is likely still in a honeymoon approval phase, though possibly for different reasons. Thyme is an avid debater in all matters and questions every nominee or bill proposal. Even if she is a freshman Senator, she has made her mark in debate.&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n<div><hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr>\n<center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center>\n<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\" alt=\"\" class=\"ad\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr></div>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-fly-guy-ind-327-net-approval\">\n      Sen. FLY GUY (Ind) – 32.7% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator FLY GUY originally ran for the 134th Senate as an independent but later joined the New People’s Party. For the purpose of current statistics, we have made statistical analyses below which classify him as both an Independent and a member of the New People’s Party.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator FLY GUY, like Thyme and Kelvin, was elected into the 134th Senate after the CTSA certification of the 134th Senate Election. Their main point of concern is the state of SimDem’s monetary policy, as evidenced by their sole bill proposal in this senate to date: the Central Banking Establishment Act. This bill comprises 7.7% of the total bills introduced in this senate session to date. It is probable that many respondents don’t know how to feel yet about FLY GUY – much like many of the freshman senators on this list.&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-notlukadebil-snp-154-net-approval\">\n      Sen. NotLukaDebiL (SNP) – 15.4% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator NotLukaDebiL (or “Luka”) is a member of the SimDem Nationalist Party, and it is his second Senate campaign – albeit his first successful one. Senator Luka has introduced two bills this senate session: the Job-Finder Act 2025 and the Repeal of the Marriage Law. While the JFA didn’t pass the Senate, the Repeal of the Marriage Act did with flying colors. Luka’s bills are based on good-intentioned ideals and tend to stem from the idea of creating equitable opportunities for all citizens of SimDem while eliminating problematic legislation from the equation.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Luka’s bills comprise 15.4% of the total bills introduced in this senate session to date – the exact same percentage as his net approval rating. If Luka’s approval ratings are indeed tied to the number of bills he introduces, then all he needs to increase his approval is to introduce more bills.&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-dovahkiin-spqr-86-net-approval\">\n      Sen. Dovahkiin (SPQR) – 8.6% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator Dovahkiin (or “Dovah”) is a member of Senatus Populusque Romanum – another legacy and well-established SimDem party. Senator Dovah has neither been particularly active in the 134th’s debates nor votes, and he has the fourth-lowest approval rating – making it curious as to how or why he was elected in the first place. However, Senator Dovah’s voting data may shine some light on this conundrum.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Dovah was elected with the second-most first-place votes – eight – but has the fourth-lowest approval rating. This indicates that he has a central group that favors his experience and supports him, but not many others necessarily approve of him. To reliably analyze and extrapolate more specifics as to Dovah’s approval trends, we will need to see more activity from him.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-noll-ind-07-net-approval\">\n      Sen. Noll (Ind) – -0.7% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator Noll is an independent senator, and he is the President of Voices of Democracy. He is a frequent contributor to Senate debates and has been a curious and avid learner. As the President of Voices of Democracy, it is likely that much of his disapproval ratings come from respondents who are unhappy with his affiliation with VoD. Like many Senate newcomers, we cannot accurately analyze Noll’s approval causes until we see more activity from and/or data on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-eleanor-qqq-175-net-approval\">\n      Sen. Eleanor (QQQ) – -17.5% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator Eleanor is a member of the Queer Queens Qlub, and she is an incumbent member of the 133rd Senate. Eleanor has not submitted any bills in this Senate session, but she has been an integral contributor to debate. It is likely that, despite this contribution, the respondents do not look favorably upon her given the recent controversial arrests and trials of QQQ members and affiliates DominaX, Kassady, Decatherinated, and NotCom.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"sen-kelvin-fbp-335-net-approval\">\n      Sen. Kelvin (FBP) – -33.5% Net Approval\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Senator Kelvin is a member of the Fucking Best Party, and he is a long-time incumbent, as he has served the Senate continuously since before the Danyo Immigration Wave. What is curious, though, is how he was elected to the 134th Senate in the first place. What we know as of now is he was elected into the 134th Senate after the CTSA certification of the 134th Senate Election. Unlike Dovah, Senator Kelvin is active in Senate votes. However, much like Senator Dovah, he likely has a central group that favors his experience and supports him, but not many others necessarily approve of him.\n  </p>\n\n    <h4 id=\"lessugreaterparty-statisticslessugreater\">\n      <u>Party Statistics</u>\n    </h4>\n\n  <p>\n    During this senate, thirteen bills have been introduced.

This proportion tracks partially because of the NPP’s Senate delegates. The political players within NPP – namely MyPenJustBroke and Stalin – are experienced bill writers with clear legislative preferences and goals.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"the-centrelessbrgreater\">\n      The Centre<br>\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    The Centre holds just 8.33% of the Senate seats – with Ppatpat being the sole delegate. However, the party is very similar to the NPP in that their bill proposal numbers punch above their weight. The Centre has proposed 23.1% of the bills introduced in this Senate session to date. Additionally, Ppatpat is another adept political player who is both versed in bill writing and Senate procedure.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"simdem-nationalist-party\">\n      SimDem Nationalist Party\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Like the Centre, SNP holds just 8.33% of the Senate seats, as Luka is the sole SNP delegate to the 134th. That being said, the SNP has proposed 15.4% of the bills in this Senate session to date. This points much more to Luka’s ability to recognize and write electorate-supported bills while also presenting platform-compliant legislation, as is seen by both of his proposals in this Senate.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"independents\">\n      Independents\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Independents hold between 8.33% and 16.66% of the Senate seats, but they have proposed between 7.7% and 15.4% of the bills introduced in this Senate to date. These statistics, no matter which party you assign FLY GUY to, suggest that independents are toeing the line with specific single-issue bills which match their personal platforms – as is further evidenced by Tau’s sole introduction of the TEA Voting Amendment.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"independent-voter-leanings\">\n      Independent Voter Leanings\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Of the 37 poll respondents, seven of those respondents – or 18.92% – self-identify as independent voters. In order to better understand where these independent voters lie ideologically, we asked them to select a party that they most identify with, if there was any.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n<div><div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/21576684\"><script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"></script><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/21576684/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"chart visualization\"  data-is-external-image=\"true\"></noscript></div>\n</div>\n\n  <p>\n    Three of the seven – or 42.9% – independent respondents responded that they lean the most towards the New People’s Party. One respondent – or 14.3% – leaned the most towards the Nationalist Action Party/Revolutionary Action Party. Another one respondent identified with the Centre, and the last two respondents – or 28.6% – did not lean towards any party in particular.<br>\n  </p>\n<div><h4>Share article:</h4>\n<center>\n<button onclick=\"copyURL()\">Copy link</button>\n<script>\nfunction copyURL() {\n let url = document.location.href\nnavigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(function() {\n    console.log('Copied!');\n}, function() {\n    console.log('Copy error')\n});\n}\n</script>\n</center>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.commoninja.com/sdk/latest/commonninja.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"commonninja_component pid-bce4f8ea-9bd1-4793-88bc-63467f850c33\"></div>\n<script>\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {\n    const elements = document.querySelectorAll('.flourish-credit');\n    elements.forEach(element => {\n    element.remove();\n    })\n});\n</script>\n</div>",

Although a cursory glance may not raise any eyebrows (after all, both are extremely experienced, having served at all levels of government in years past), the ticket, and the election at large, brought to light a series of serious issues. In looking deeper into the issue, I aim to answer two questions: Was this inevitable? And where do we go from here?\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Just two and a half weeks ago, the Call for Candidates (CFC) for the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SimDemocracy/comments/1id4lt3/134th_senatorial_election_call_for_candidates/\"  class=\"extlink extlink-icon-1\"  >134th Presidential Election</a> was opened, closing with 22 candidates to be placed on the ballot.

Despite Imade indicating that they would seek to leave politics after a second term and providing tacit support for an announced Tripod-Creative ticket in an interview at the beginning of their second term, that clearly did not pan out.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Tripod continued to run, of course, but with Creative heading his own ticket, Tripod was resigned to running on the platform of continuing the work of the front-running VP candidate while claiming that her VP would be the front-running presidential candidate. That's certainly not an enviable position.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Lastly, there was Bakob, a USL member like Imade who had a single campaign promise: he named Imade as his VP and vowed, if elected, to resign immediately so Imade could serve a third term. The craziest part? Bakob actually moved on to the runoff stage against the Creative-Imade ticket.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>To be clear, this means that the competition in the runoff was to determine whether Imade would serve a third term as president or be Creative's VP in an administration that aimed to continue and expand Imade's reforms.&nbsp;</b>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Regardless of one's views on the previous administration, it is clear that this election was a distraction—Imade would remain at the highest level of government for another two weeks and their ideas would continue to guide the executive no matter who won. There was <i>never</i> any doubt.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    There was no viable competition; how could there be? At the core of this issue is The Liberty Coalition (TLC), a coalition of the Lemon Party (LP), New People's Party (NPP), United Socialist League (USL), and the Centre (C). This coalition, based solely on <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/554769523635650580/1028627919993585745/1338044307201986590\"  class=\"extlink extlink-icon-1\"  >role numbers</a>, makes up nearly 60% of all party-affiliated members and has even more weight to throw around when considering the relative inactivity of SPQR and the legal sanctions on most of the QQQ&nbsp;(the only other major parties). They also make up half of the current Senate, whereas the remaining senators are largely either independent or unpopular with most of the electorate.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The numbers don't lie: without some sort of breakage within TLC, there is no viable opposition.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Defenders of the current arrangement have argued that this is democracy in action. \"The Creative-Imade campaign won in a landslide, so people clearly wanted this. There's no conspiracy.\"\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    To that, I say: <br>People supported the winning ticket in droves, sure, but there was already no viable opposition to their campaign by the time the election rolled around. With most of the major parties backing a single ticket and even a field of candidates whose sole goal was to keep Imade in power, there was only the illusion of choice.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    As for a conspiracy, I don't believe that TLC's goal is a shadow government that rigs elections in their favor. My reason for including the Carlin quote at the start was to highlight a similar sentiment. In Senate elections, there are many winners since there are many seats to go around; coalitions for those elections are largely proposals for governing coalitions should each party gain the numbers they need.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    In presidential elections, however, there can only be one winner; coalitions here are far less strictly ideological and more strategic. To that end, each party in TLC saw the coalition as beneficial and the Creative-Imade ticket as at least \"good enough,\" so the plan was set. In fact, I'd argue that as soon as any two of the four parties joined forces, the decision to either join in or form an opposing coalition became necessary in order for any other party to guarantee a chance that their voice would be heard in the new administration.\n  </p>\n<div><hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr>\n<center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center>\n<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\" alt=\"\" class=\"ad\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr></div>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>So was this inevitable? Under our current laws, yes.</b>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    To prevent another coalition like this directly would be illegal due to constitutional protections for freedom of speech and association. However, there is at least a way to prevent triple-term (and longer) administrations: term limits.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The idea is highly controversial and was especially so in the earlier days of SimDem where the same 30 or so people were expected to fill 10 executive positions, a sizable Senate, a Supreme Court and lower court seats, and make up a voting populace. In such a situation, restrictions on who could serve where and when were impractical.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Since then, our community has grown massively and there are a number of members looking for government or private jobs. We have an abundance of people who have passed the bar (all ten versions of it). There is no need to worry about whether jobs or positions can be filled; the greatest threats now are corruption and complacency.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Even if a dictator (used here very loosely to highlight the extended rule of a single person/group) is popularly elected, the power that they have over the government and the length of their rule makes those two dangers easy to come by. In this case, it is the soft power of the ruling TLC and its satellite members that makes those threats real.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    For those reasons, I argue that <b>a limit of two consecutive terms should be placed on the presidency</b> and that anyone who serves those two terms must then <b>wait an additional two terms before running again.</b> This still gives each administration up to a month to make the changes they wish to see a reality while giving other candidates (even if within the same party) a shot at the highest office. Of course, in another month, they could run again and even win if there is enough demand, but this should at least prevent complacency at the executive level.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    You may note that this proposal alone would not have stopped Imade from serving as Creative's VP after two terms, thereby not resolving the primary issue. That's why I also propose that, much like in the United States, <b>anyone who is ineligible to be President should not be able to run for Vice President.</b> This change, in conjunction with the first, should make it far more difficult for a single person or group to control SimDem politics for an extended period.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    These changes may be difficult to implement, needing a constitutional amendment to guarantee their effectiveness, but that is no reason not to push for it. I welcome debate on the finer points of the plan and hope to find a solution that is amenable to all, but above all, we must put the sanctity of the free vote (and of democracy) first.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>Break free from the illusion of choice and push the Senate to make change now.</b>\n  </p>\n<div><h4>Share article:</h4>\n<center>\n<button onclick=\"copyURL()\">Copy link</button>\n<script>\nfunction copyURL() {\n let url = document.location.href\nnavigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(function() {\n    console.log('Copied!');\n}, function() {\n    console.log('Copy error')\n});\n}\n</script>\n</center>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.commoninja.com/sdk/latest/commonninja.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"commonninja_component pid-bce4f8ea-9bd1-4793-88bc-63467f850c33\"></div></div>",
