After joining in late February, he took the bar exam and started a lucrative business as a defense attorney for some of SimDem's most controversial members, from alleged slur spammers to sexual harassers.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Although some may find such a job immoral, defense attorneys for all crimes are a necessary part of our justice system, and Nf19 was considered one of the most dedicated to his clients. However, due to his profession and his actions outside of court (such as many repeated attempts to encourage people to invest in his business ventures under suspicious circumstances), he was a polarizing figure.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Despite this, he climbed the ranks of the government, becoming involved with the DOJ and State Department, even serving as an ambassador to the Republic of Julia. Yet, without warning, on March 30, 2025, he left all SimDem-affiliated servers, leaving his legal clients and shares of stock behind.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    At the same time, unbeknownst to the public, the OHS had a massive problem—there was a mole.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    On March 23, 2025, TIDE leader Barbacue revealed to the group's members that he gained access to a \"TIDE watchlist\" allegedly belonging to OHS. Guava, as TIDE Vice Chairman but still posing as an ex-TIDE member in SimDem, forwarded the information to then-OHS Director Notcom to confirm its validity. Notcom played it off, assuring Guava that it was a fabrication meant to lure him back into TIDE. It wasn't.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/Screenshot-2025-04-11-035305.png\" height=\"1303\" width=\"1068\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-11-035305-xs.png 640w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-11-035305-sm.png 768w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-11-035305-md.png 1024w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-11-035305-lg.png 1366w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-11-035305-xl.png 1600w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-11-035305-2xl.png 1920w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    Recognizing the gravity of the situation, Notcom took swift action: all of the OHS's intelligence on TIDE was removed from SimDem and quarantined in a server titled \"New vegas fan club,\" in reference to the game <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. Notcom then invited only the few closest OHS agents he knew could be trusted and began to investigate who was leaking information to TIDE.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Noting that the document leaked was only shared between OHS and DOJ, within 24 hours the mole was determined to be Nf19. However, no action was taken to remove Nf19 so as to not give away that OHS was onto him. The leaks stopped and, within days, Nf19 left of his own accord.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This New Vegas server, although it may have succeeded in its original goal, created a dilemma; when Notcom resigned as OHS Director a week after Nf19's departure, he transferred the role to Mythrows, along with ownership of the server. That same day, Notcom (and shortly later Myth) were arrested on the (previously-debunked) charges, as outlined in a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FneGhAHzjxlwLtp9HRUxbteb1GjjOu7xswycAxwXng4/edit?tab=t.0\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"extlink extlink-icon-1\"  >document written and signed by newly-elected President Mypen</a>.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    So, the stage was set: Myth and Notcom had full control of the server which held all of the OHS's intelligence from the investigations into TIDE and other threats, and they were just arrested on charges they knew were exaggerated or outright false. Believing that the Mypen administration was fully aware of the illegality of their arrests, they chose to use the only leverage they had—they took the server hostage.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    For a time, chaos was in control of the administration; the OHS couldn't continue their investigations into TIDE without the evidence they had already gathered, the DOJ lost access to the evidence for planned and ongoing charges, and SDIOA lacked its oversight access to a critical part of SimDem's inner systems.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    In a particularly shocking moment, when this publication attempted to file <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gBSEyYeBpA8wYMF_cQ06_OFB3dsUDnW7JnvSOYMz_dQ/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"extlink extlink-icon-1\"  >a FOIA request</a> for access to Operation Kashmir (PUP counter-intelligence) documents, we were told that the relevant agencies could not provide <i>any&nbsp;documents</i>, confidential or not, because they simply had none.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    That leverage was enough to bring the Mypen administration to the negotiating table, the result of which was described at the start of this piece. However, the story doesn't end there; soon after the deal was finalized and Notcom and Myth were freed, there were rumblings that Mypen intended to go back on the deal and dissolve the OHS anyway. This, combined with animosity by Governor Lucas and MBH in the aftermath of their release (based on the incomplete information the public had at the time) led Myth to refuse to hand over the server.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    In that time, the Gazette unexpectedly gained access to a great deal of information—the entire server's contents were visible. For a short few hours, this publication had more access to the government's documents than the government itself. Although that access was quickly revoked and the server soon given to the administration, it sent the scope of our investigation ballooning.<br><br>The next article in this series, which will hopefully be published in the next 24 hours, will cover some of the important information we learned through our access and various separate leaks that the public needs to know.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Who is really behind TIDE? What was TIDE's plan for the stock market? Why was Toast banned from Discord? Are there other TIDE alts in SimDem?

What led to your decision to resign?\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    I have been in that role for ten weeks after this election ends. I always knew I wanted to go and do something else eventually because my plan wasn't even to be Treasury Secretary, but I feel that I did a lot in the department and even though I love that job just that it was time for a change for myself.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"you-mention-you-wanted-change-how-has-the-role-affected-you-personally\" class=\"align-center\">\n      You mention you wanted change; how has the role affected you personally?\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Well, I'm not gonna lie; for the first week or two in the role I didn't feel like I was allowed to have a life. I felt like I had to be glued to my screen in case I missed something important that I was needed for, but I learned that isn't the case. I feel like I've been pretty outspoken about people bothering government officials or really anyone with a job on the server because it can make you feel a little trapped. Other than that, all of the effects have been positive. I have met a bunch of people and heard different points of view I never would have otherwise. Serving SimDem in this way has given me things I wouldn't have without the role, so I will always be thankful for this stop in my SimDem story.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"was-there-a-specific-moment-or-event-that-solidified-your-decision-to-step-down\" class=\"align-center\">\n      Was there a specific moment or event that solidified your decision to step down?\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    No, not anything specifically. I just knew after last election that I needed a change; I normally don't do one thing for too long anyways, plus ten weeks in the role just sounds nice lmao.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"did-you-feel-adequately-supported-by-the-rest-of-the-administration-whether-through-public-response-or-privately\" class=\"align-center\">\n      Did you feel adequately supported by the rest of the administration, whether through public response or privately?\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Yeah! When I went on vacation under Muggy, they told me I could take as much time as necessary and I told Ferris it would be my last term before they were even elected. Everyone has supported me and been as nice as possible through the whole process.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"thats-great-to-hear-looking-back-what-do-you-consider-your-greatest-achievement-in-office\" class=\"align-center\">\n      That's great to hear! Looking back, what do you consider your greatest achievement in office?\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    I would say the amount of businesses opened. Writing legislation and giving orders and stuff is fun, but when someone opens a business they open themselves up to a risk. Since my confirmation, over 40 businesses have taken that risk to try to better themselves but also the economy as a whole. It genuinely makes me happy to know that people are coming up with ideas and doing what they can to expand our economy everyday; nothing could replace that to me.\n  </p>\n<div><hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr>\n<center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center>\n<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\" alt=\"\" class=\"ad\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr></div>\n\n    <h6 id=\"on-the-topic-of-business-and-more-specifically-the-economy-how-would-you-describe-the-current-state-of-simdems-finances\" class=\"align-center\">\n      On the topic of business and more specifically the economy, how would you describe the current state of SimDem’s finances?\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    I think it's improving, just slowly. I think sometimes people forget where we were a few weeks ago when I took over. Stipends hadn't been paid in at least a week, pay took at a minimum double the time it takes now, the Treasury Department had 3-4 less departments, and there had been very little contact between the economy and the public. Change, especially in economics, is incredibly slow and I think that, as much as people rightly think we should have a better economy than we do now, we should also be proud of the improvements we have made so far. After being able to work with both current options for my replacement, I have nothing but faith in the fact that either one of them will be able to not only continue the positive growth, but put us on an even faster track.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"you-believe-there-was-little-contact-between-the-economy-and-the-public-back-then-i-want-to-extend-my-question-to-ask-whats-your-view-on-simdems-current-approach-to-economic-transparencyandnbsplessbrgreater\" class=\"align-center\">\n      You believe there was little contact between the economy and the public back then.

Public interaction is never something I've backed away from.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"speaking-of-foias-you-might-have-received-some-from-external-government-agencies-did-the-treasury-ever-clash-with-other-government-departments\" class=\"align-center\">\n      Speaking of FOIAs, you might have received some from external government agencies. Did the Treasury ever clash with other government departments?\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    No, never. We maintained good relations with all departments because we have to work with all departments, but also because there were never any issues. I loved serving with all of my fellow cabinet members across all four presidents.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"when-you-mean-all-departments-i-cant-help-but-think-of-the-senate-how-did-you-coordinate-financial-decisions-with-the-president-and-senate-especially-with-any-financial-bills-passed\" class=\"align-center\">\n      When you mean all departments, I can't help but think of the Senate. How did you coordinate financial decisions with the President and Senate, especially with any financial bills passed?\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Honestly, most financial decisions are necessary ones; I tried to make a budget process that would make the legislative and executive have to debate a budget for every presidential term but I had to get it repealed because it just didn't work. I do plan on writing a new budget bill to get that process up and running, but it just didn't work the way it was supposed to as written.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"on-the-topic-of-budgeting-how-did-you-approach-budgeting-for-government-departments\" class=\"align-center\">\n      On the topic of budgeting, how did you approach budgeting for government departments?\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    There wasn't really anything that detailed any exact process, I normally just reached out to the head of the department and we hashed out any details between us. I would then get presidential approval of that number before making it official and sending it.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"were-there-any-reforms-you-wanted-to-pursue-but-couldnt\" class=\"align-center\">\n      Were there any reforms you wanted to pursue but couldn’t?\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    There were definitely a few things I wasn't able to do, but I plan on releasing some plans on the economy and loads of other issues in <u>my campaign for the 139th Senate.</u>\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"the-139th-senate\" class=\"align-center\">\n      The 139th Senate?\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    <u>The Senate election that starts next week I will be running in!</u>\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"youve-just-stepped-down-as-treasury-secretary-and-now-youre-looking-to-win-a-senate-seat-what-changed-or-was-this-always-the-plan\" class=\"align-center\">\n      You’ve just stepped down as Treasury Secretary, and now you're looking to win a Senate seat.

One of the biggest problems in SimDem, in my opinion, is the way that campaigns are set up. Right now, candidates run for a very short period of time and don't release enough information for voters truly base their vote on. I plan to change that by running a campaign that grabs people's attention and shows people that we can do things differently.&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"some-might-say-that-your-record-as-treasury-secretary-is-now-campaign-material-do-you-welcome-that-scrutiny\" class=\"align-center\">\n      Some might say that your record as Treasury Secretary is now campaign material; do you welcome that scrutiny?\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    I have no problem with people looking back at what I've done and judging me. I have never claimed to be perfect and no matter what anyone says about my time in the department, I'm proud of what we did to further SimDem. Nobody can say anything to take that away from me or the countless other people who helped me through these ten weeks.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"hypothetically-speaking-why-should-the-same-people-who-struggled-under-your-financial-policies-now-trust-you-with-legislative-power\" class=\"align-center\">\n      Hypothetically speaking, why should the same people who struggled under your financial policies now trust you with legislative power?\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Well first of all, I'd say they don't have to. On the campaign trail, and if I'm lucky enough to win the election, I will talk to and represent every SimDem citizen, not just those who liked my financial policies and if I see any way to improve on them I won't hesitate to act to do so. You can always be better, and me and my policies are no different.\n  </p>\n<div><hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr>\n<center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center>\n<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\" alt=\"\" class=\"ad\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr></div>\n\n    <h6 id=\"what-separates-you-from-the-other-senate-hopefuls-besides-your-title\" class=\"align-center\">\n      What separates you from the other Senate hopefuls besides your title?\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    I think that is up for voters to decide after all the candidates have made some statements in the campaign. Of course I think that I would do great in the job and represent the people well, but so does every other candidate, so I don't think that there's anything that separates us yet.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"do-you-believe-the-senate-has-been-effective-in-recent-terms-if-not-how-would-you-change-that\" class=\"align-center\">\n      Do you believe the Senate has been effective in recent terms? If not, how would you change that?\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    I think the problems with the Senate recently have been some legislative and some personality. I think earlier today [election day] was a good example where the Senate rushed to impeachments that may not have been necessary. I think at times the Senate needs a moral leader who can be someone others look to in times like these. SimDem needs level-headed, common sense thinkers in office, not reactionaries who do what may seem right in the short term, but are actually negative long term.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"you-stated-the-senate-needs-moral-leadership-what-does-that-look-like-in-practice\" class=\"align-center\">\n      You stated the Senate needs moral leadership. What does that look like in practice?\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    It looks like someone stepping up and saying what needs to be said. This morning, any Senator could have slowed things down and waited until there was actual evidence before making claims or motioning for impeachment, but they didn't. When you're dealing with things of that nature, you need to be patient and wait for all relevant information to be released instead of relying on #general for your evidence.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"when-the-senate-acts-out-of-emotion-or-reaction-whats-the-long-term-damage-to-simdems-institutions\" class=\"align-center\">\n      When the Senate acts out of emotion or reaction, what’s the long-term damage to SimDem’s institutions?\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Well, some of it is visible and tangible immediately, but the real toll is trust in SimDem's institutions. This goes for everyone in power, not just the Senate, but if people in power continually rush important decisions, people will not trust those in power. Losing the trust of the public is a dangerous game to play if you want to accomplish anything.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"what-lessons-from-your-time-as-treasury-secretary-would-you-bring-into-senate-deliberations-especially-during-moments-like-today\" class=\"align-center\">\n      What lessons from your time as Treasury Secretary would you bring into Senate deliberations especially during moments like today?\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    Patience.

Things can always be painted any way someone wants in the short term; the long term is what separates fact from lie.\n  </p>\n\n    <h6 id=\"how-would-you-plan-to-work-with-senators-who-have-publicly-displayed-their-disapproval-or-hatred-of-you-or-your-departments-various-activities\" class=\"align-center\">\n      How would you plan to work with senators who have publicly displayed their disapproval or hatred of you or your department's various activities?\n    </h6>\n\n  <p>\n    I don't hold those kinds of things against people.

Light and truth. The role of journalism is to shed light where darkness rests and to break the shields and covers that protect the secrets hidden beneath. Journalism isn’t about playing mediator; it’s about putting reality on full display.<br><br>This past week has been eventful: the election of President Ferris; the bribery and brigade charges against former President Muggy; the arrest of Voices of Democracy (VoD) President Noll on hate speech and conspiracy charges; and the resignation of numerous officials and senators, including but not limited to former Vice President Thyme and former Attorney General Terak. I could spend this entire article simply recounting these events and offering my commentary, but there are plenty of other news sources and individuals who can do so with greater efficiency.<br><br>Instead, I want to focus on something that often gets glossed over in the grand scheme of things: the relationship between our democracy and Voices of Democracy (VoD) and perhaps even our relationship with political simulations as a whole.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    To explain this, I need to revisit the so-called war that occurred. War raged between SimDem and VoD, sparked by nothing more than a “no balls” dare between former President Muggy and VoD President Noll. This led to the activation of the military, who, alongside many patriotic shitposters, engaged in warfare through memes, video edits, and songs.<br><br>On its own, this is sheer humor; but what particularly interested me was the short fallout that occurred between the former administration and the Senate over negotiations on a peace treaty between SimDem and VoD, sparking debate on the Senate floor that even extended to the Senate executive channels.<br><br>I interviewed Senate Speaker Lucas to gain his insight, seeing as he was the most informed on the issue. Lucas provided some very useful information in our interview, particularly about the role and cause of the negotiations, stating:\n  </p>\n<div><hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr>\n<center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center>\n<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\" alt=\"\" class=\"ad\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr>\n</div>\n\n    <blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n      \"We were going to do this exercise completely for the ease of the executive so that they do not have to run back and forth between both legislatures.\"\n    </blockquote>\n\n  <p>\n    But inevitably, the question that lingers is one of consequence: there is no sidestepping it, no brushing it aside; it demands to be confronted. What happened? What led to the fallout and the eventual withdrawal of the joint session between SimDem and VoD to negotiate peace? When faced with this question, Lucas gave me a meandering response that summarized his point of view:\n  </p>\n\n    <blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n      \"To give you the most unbiased, impartial answer, the executive wants to conduct the negotiations themselves and opposes the session, and we have no interest in doing that.\"<br>\n    </blockquote>\n\n  <p>\n    At first glance, Lucas’s position seems neutral; yet, if the matter was so simple, why did it spark such a divide? A compromise could have been found easily. Or could it? To that, Lucas gave me his two cents on what he thought had occurred from his point of view:\n  </p>\n\n    <blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n      \"I clarified my positions and tried all I could to appease the president, but the president only tried to make a scene out of it, throwing a partial tantrum over something that I probably had no intention of contesting them on.\"\n    </blockquote>\n\n  <p>\n    This reveals a deeper issue: the power struggle between the Senate and the executive over control of the negotiations. Lucas’s statements are only one piece of the puzzle; we have to consider the executive’s perspective too. Thus, I conducted an interview with then-President Muggy with one goal in mind: what was the root of this issue? When asked about the Senate’s role, Muggy’s response was particularly interesting:\n  </p>\n\n    <blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n      \"I believe the Senate should have no authority over negotiations. That is the executive’s job through and through.\"\n    </blockquote>\n\n  <p>\n    It is essential to consider that while these negotiations became a point of contention, it’s worth questioning whether they were ever truly necessary at all.\n<br>\n<br>All these disputes stemmed from one thing: negotiating peace. But there was no war to begin with. The VoD Senate came to a consensus through voting that rejected the declaration of war with us. So all of this was for naught in the first place, and this exact fact has led to a lawsuit being filed against Muggy; though that did not stop us from considering the implications; because if there was never a war, then what were we really negotiating?\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Was it a peace deal, or was it something else - a power struggle disguised as diplomacy? The Senate and the executive fought for control over a negotiation that, in hindsight, had no real substance. It raises the question: was this about VoD at all, or was it just another battlefield in our own internal conflicts?\n<br>\n<br>And if that’s the case, then perhaps the divide we should be talking about isn’t just between SimDem and VoD but within SimDem itself.\n<br>\n<br>Public opinion on VoD is anything but unanimous. To some, VoD represents an ideological adversary, a foreign entity; some would even go as far as to call it a political monstrosity incompatible with our principles. To others, it’s just another community: an opportunity for cross-community engagement, maybe even a potential ally. And then, there are those who don’t even care about VoD at all, viewing it as irrelevant to SimDem’s actual governance.\n<br>\n<br>A clear example of our evolving relationship with VoD is the term voddite. Once a slur used to mock VoD members, it has since been reclaimed, even by VoD’s own officials, as a casual label. At first glance, this might seem trivial, but it speaks to a larger truth: the divide between SimDem and VoD isn’t as clear as we like to think. Many in SimDem hold positions in VoD, just as VoD officials have influence here. The overlap isn’t just social; it is political.\n<br>\n<br>Nowhere is this clearer than in the rise of the SIMDEM party within VoD. Originally founded to represent SimDemmish interests, it remained small until then-President Muggy took control and rapidly expanded its influence. This growth was not without controversy, as allegations of bribery and financial incentives followed, raising questions about the party’s legitimacy.\n  </p>\n<div><hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr>\n<center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center>\n<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\" alt=\"\" class=\"ad\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr></div>\n\n  <p>\n    At the same time, Muggy herself held one of the most powerful positions in VoD as Speaker of the House. This was not an isolated case either, as many SimDem citizens played key roles in VoD’s government. With that in mind, it is worth asking: can we really consider VoD a separate entity when so much of our own leadership has shaped it from within?\n<br>\n<br>So where does that leave us? Should we cut ties, blacklist VoD, or even go to war? That is a foreign policy debate and one I will not try to settle. But what I will say is this: our relationship with VoD isn’t just about diplomacy. It is a reflection of the divisions within SimDem itself.\n<br>\n<br>The negotiations debacle exposed a rift, not just between SimDem and VoD but within our own institutions. The Senate and the executive clashed over a matter that, in hindsight, had no real consequence. Yet, this was not the first time we have seen such a divide, nor will it be the last. When faced with an external force; whether it be VoD, another political entity, or even an ideological shift - we see where our true fault lines lie.\n<br>\n<br>This brings us to a critical question: is VoD merely an external challenge, or is it an accelerant to the tensions already brewing within? The very existence of VoD as a parallel political entity has forced us to confront our own political structure, our priorities, and even our unity. Some see them as a threat, others as an opportunity, and some could not care less. But that range of opinions itself is proof of division.\n<br>\n<br>Spew, VoD’s correspondent in SimDem, acknowledged the high tensions between the two communities. When I asked him about the relationship between VoD and SimDem, he stated:\n  </p>\n\n    <blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n      \"I've been reporting extensively on the diplomatic situation between VoD and SimDem, and there are without a doubt a lot of tensions. I've personally expressed that I would like to see peace, but there appears to be very little political appetite for it. Recent events have made this worse. So yes, tensions are high, and it is a tumultuous period in SD/VoD relations.\"\n\n    </blockquote>\n\n  <p>\n    This situation can either make the camel’s back or break it. The presence of VoD in our discourse forces us to answer uncomfortable questions about governance, authority, and allegiance. If we cannot agree on how to handle them, what does that say about us? If their mere existence can spark a crisis, then perhaps the issue is not VoD itself, but the fragility of our own cohesion.\n<br>\n<br>Yet, despite the high tensions and political fractures, there remains hope for resolution. Spew himself, despite recognizing the difficulties ahead, still believes in the potential for peace:\n  </p>\n\n    <blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n      \"Eventually, I think so. There probably will be peace talks that restart at some stage, but it will take some time and political changes. But yes, the two communities have a shared history and largely a shared membership - so it makes sense that we will at some stage come to a compromise.\"\n\n    </blockquote>\n\n  <p>\n    One way or another, tensions with VoD will settle: through diplomacy, conflict, or simple exhaustion. But if this situation has proven anything, it’s that VoD is not the real issue. It is a symptom, not a disease.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The fractures in SimDem run deeper than a foreign policy debate; they manifest in our governance, our institutions, and our leadership itself. The Senate and executive do not need VoD to find themselves at odds. SimDem does not need an external enemy to be divided. This was never just about VoD; it was about us, and it still is. How we navigate this moment will not just define our relationship with VoD; it will define SimDem itself.\n  </p>\n<div><h4>Share article:</h4>\n<center>\n<button onclick=\"copyURL()\">Copy link</button>\n<script>\nfunction copyURL() {\n let url = document.location.href\nnavigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(function() {\n    console.log('Copied!');\n}, function() {\n    console.log('Copy error')\n});\n}\n</script>\n</center>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.commoninja.com/sdk/latest/commonninja.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"commonninja_component pid-bce4f8ea-9bd1-4793-88bc-63467f850c33\"></div></div>",

In the realm of law, navigating that boundary is left to judges, who are admired and promoted for their prowess in understanding and interpreting legislation.<br><br>We trust judges to rely on precedent in most cases, only overturning egregious miscarriages of justice that are often the result of nearsightedness or partisanship. In the ruling of \"In re Appeal of Summary Ban - \"mc_uighilin\" (u/Panzzrr) [2025] SDSC2\" (hereafter \"the Panzzrr case\"), the Supreme Court has overturned a fundamental precedent that has kept SimDemocracy alive as long as it has: the supremacy of the relevant platform's Terms of Service.<br><br>This flawed judgment, made in the name of protecting due process, opens the door for abuse and the death of SimDemocracy.<br><br>Not long ago, the SimDem community celebrated its sixth anniversary—this year's festivities were marked by the massive increase in the citizen population that occurred just a month prior due to the viral video posted by longtime member Danyo (Trolligarch). Then and since, many of the \"older generation\" (i.e. those who were citizens before the most recent immigration wave) noted that SimDem in earlier years was far more permissive of toxic behavior and harassment.<br><br>Some members, such as Toast, look fondly upon that era, but the vast majority of citizens are at least content with the protections in place to prevent that conduct, if not interested in strengthening them. Additionally, the Discord Terms of Service (and, by extension, Community Guidelines) have been strengthened in recent years to prevent harmful conduct such as harassment of marginalized groups, the proliferation of CSAM and misinformation, and hate speech in the form of genocide denial. <br><br>The tools used and care taken on behalf of Discord have improved over the years as it has faced more scrutiny and the \"nuking\" (the complete removal of a server, up to and including the banning of its members) of hateful or otherwise harmful servers is something I've seen only increase in that same period. <br><br>The Supreme Court ruling in the Panzzrr case opens our beloved community up to that same fate.<br><br>In SimDem's history, there have been no small number of people banned under the Discord Terms of Service; many for hate speech in all its forms, but others for issues far more serious—and illegal. I need not elaborate on the specific details of those cases to spare any reader the time and disgust, but the proper course of action is clear: a ban. A final, permanent ban.<br><br>As much as we want to believe that we are a government or nation-state, we are not. We cannot make decisions on cases that risk our place on the platform or lead to criminal records. At a certain point, we must admit that there are \"SimDem crimes\" too serious to permit by allowing the offender to stay on the server for a trial, or even to keep in contact with.<br><br>Every judge, besides those ruling in this case, was well aware of that fact—nay, common sense.<br><br>However, this group of three (themselves not without controversy) have not only rebuked that approach but applied the ruling retroactively. Hundreds of the most vile people to ever \"step foot\" in SimDem are now, according to the Court, constitutionally guaranteed the right to return.<br><br>There has never, in my estimation and that of esteemed citizens far more knowledgeable than I, been a Supreme Court ruling so dangerous or detrimental to our community than this.<br><br>Multiple prominent members, including Danyo himself, who brought so many of us back or introduced us to SimDem for the first time, have already indicated that they no longer wish to remain in the server given the risk of its \"nuking.\" I cannot blame them.<br><br>In fact, although I've had my issues with the server in the past, I (like so many others) have always felt drawn to the community for one reason or another. There has never been a more compelling reason to leave.<br><br>I will not take this space to encourage people to leave immediately, however; instead, I encourage anyone who has read thus far to take action. Push the Senate to pass legislation immediately to overturn the ruling and hold the Supreme Court justices accountable for what is, at its best, a complete lack of foresight and sound judgment.<br><br>If all else fails, then leaving is indeed the only choice left, if only to protect your account.<br><br>Our democracy has not yet died; do not let this opportunity to save it slip away.\n  </p>\n<div><h4>Share article:</h4>\n<center>\n<button onclick=\"copyURL()\">Copy link</button>\n<script>\nfunction copyURL() {\n let url = document.location.href\nnavigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(function() {\n    console.log('Copied!');\n}, function() {\n    console.log('Copy error')\n});\n}\n</script>\n</center>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.commoninja.com/sdk/latest/commonninja.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"commonninja_component pid-bce4f8ea-9bd1-4793-88bc-63467f850c33\"></div>\n</div>",

The SDSE (SimDemocracy Stock Exchange) is an independent project where entrepreneurs and investors can trade public business stocks.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The SDSE was created during a time when the economy was stagnant, lacking the mobility and monetary flux that stable economies rely on, as per the words of u/frisianoutlaw – a major investor and founder of the SDSE.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    With few outlets for spending available, people turned to entrepreneurship and high-risk ventures like gambling, but for those seeking structured, long-term investment opportunities, SDSE provided a new, organized alternative&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The economy is always shifting, reflecting the constant change of power in government leadership and workforce. While new taxation policies have been introduced to stabilize revenue streams, the SDSE remains largely untouched by regulatory oversight. The question now is whether the SDSE can prove itself to become an essential pillar of the economy, or will remain a side project hindered by the various fiscal problems our democracy faces—a question I hope to answer by the end of this article.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    A major detail I pointedly did not mention earlier in my explanation of the SDSE is that the SDSE has, as of the writing of this article, no government regulations imposed on it. Unlike other sources of revenue, which are subject to taxation, such as wages and personal income—the SDSE remains untouched by government oversight.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This regulatory gap is significant because, while taxation and oversight can provide stability, they also introduce friction that discourages investment. SDSE’s current freedom from government intervention gives it a special opportunity to grow dynamically; provided it can gain the public’s trust.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Moreover, this also raises questions about the SDSE’s long-term role in the economy. To explore this point further, let’s consider both the opinions of investors and the insight of the government through its financial policies.\n  </p>\n<div><hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr>\n<center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center>\n<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\" alt=\"\" class=\"ad\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr></div>\n\n  <p>\n    You might believe that the SDSE is too young and undeveloped to rely on or even pursue in terms of financial reserves, but in the eyes of many investors: the SDSE is growing sustainably. Every week, stocks are exchanged and new businesses are listed to the public. This is NOT a call for you to go spend your life savings on stocks; far from it actually, as the stock exchange is misunderstood by many and underplayed.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Nf19_1, a lawyer and investor whom I interviewed for his broad knowledge of the market, believes that the stock exchange is perceived by many as a game of fate. Buy low, sell high—just like the roll of dice; however, Nf19_1 argues that the market follows patterns that need to be analyzed and leveraged. Nf19_1 is also one of the few that recognize the real obstacle that faces the SDSE: financial engagement is not yet an essential part of life.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Stock investments rely on confidence – that is a fact known by many. Where brokers like Nf19_1 identify profitable opportunities in companies like SimDem Today and GatoPoll, other people remain dormant. The lack of public interest in finance means that SDSE’s influence is of limited reach.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    And why is that a problem per se? Without active engagement, the market risks stagnation. This economic stagnation will not only be a failure of the SDSE itself but rather a sign that financial literacy and economic participation must be encouraged.  This is the problem that started the SDSE in the first place and the reason why I stated that it may persist. The challenge, the main obstacle that lies in front, is to connect those who see the value of the SDSE and those who do not.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    What is the role of the government in this? The government’s economic strategy indirectly supports SDSE’s growth by focusing on stability and self-actualization. Recently, the Senate introduced the Government Bond Expansion Act. To spare you the technical details, which you can obtain by reading the Act, this legislation defines the various forms of government bonds provided. By giving the Treasury the ability to issue the different types of bonds at need, this act births a new avenue for investment.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    And how does the SDSE relate to bond expansion? Well, a bond market could integrate seamlessly with the stock exchange. Bonds and stocks are different at their core and they serve different purposes but they provide complementary roles. Bonds provide economic stability, while stocks drive growth.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Markets with both stocks and bonds tend to have more mature economies. For example, in the real world, you have the U.S. Treasury and Wall Street, the London Stock Exchange, and government gilts. Many examples worldwide can prove and assert that bonds and stocks coexisting can enhance a country’s financial stability.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    One might argue that what differentiates us from the examples I gave above is that, in the real world, there is a need for money—there is a desire to obtain money on a large scale that is not present in a simulation. However, that assumption overlooks a crucial factor: the role of structured financial systems in shaping economic behavior.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Even in a simulation of a democracy, where basic survival does not hinge on wealth, incentives, or competition – investment still drives economic activity. The absence of necessity does not eliminate the demand for a stock exchange, it merely transforms it shifting the focus from survival, or what you can perceive as survival, to influence, growth, and financial incentive.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    But is the economy really in such dire need of the stock exchange? To be more clear—how is the economy performing? Is the government able to control and manage its finances in a self-sufficient and efficient manner?\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/kuguk.png\" height=\"530\" width=\"912\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/responsive/kuguk-xs.png 640w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/responsive/kuguk-sm.png 768w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/responsive/kuguk-md.png 1024w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/responsive/kuguk-lg.png 1366w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/responsive/kuguk-xl.png 1600w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/responsive/kuguk-2xl.png 1920w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    If we were to describe the data above, it would be clear that the government's accounts are fluctuant in their current state. January saw significant income outweighing spending, but by February the government’s expenses had skyrocketed. March, though incomplete in records, suggests a sharp decline in income revenue.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The structural weaknesses present in the Treasury have been highlighted by both Secretary of Treasury Matt Cheney, and his predecessor, FLY GUY 215, who voiced his thoughts and experiences in a similar article here. The focus of the Treasury at the current time is to lay out the foundation upon which to develop the economy, which is why the SDSE has been left fairly unregulated for the time being.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This may perhaps lead to your question: how can the government integrate the SDSE into the current economic infrastructure? Should the SDSE be regulated? Taxed? Subsidized? Well, not exactly.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    You see, many investors and shareholders—including Loger, founding member of ROSE and major investor of GatoPoll who I interviewed for the research of this article, share a common sentiment in that taxing the stock exchange would lead to negative behavior from investors and may as a consequence halt trading all-together. Loger also believes that there is no need for legislation amidst the current volume of trade.\n  </p>\n<div><hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr>\n<center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center>\n<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\" alt=\"\" class=\"ad\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr></div>\n\n  <p>\n    This raises a significant question: how can the government integrate SDSE into the economy without stifling its growth? The point I’m trying to make is that the investors, like Logan, believe that a poorly implemented or restrictive implementation of legislations and policies is destructive to the stock exchange and the fall of the stock exchange may attribute a large loss in circulation and monetary flow for the economy as a whole.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The Treasury acknowledges the importance of tax reforms and legislation, but insists that they must be based on thorough research and long-term data rather than rushed policies. Implementing policies in a haste would not only cause public distress but also damage the already fragile economic infrastructure currently present.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Secretary of Treasury Matt Cheney has emphasized in an interview that I conducted with him that he will not be making a decision in regards to regulating the SDSE without solid concrete evidence and data that suggests otherwise, stating:\n  </p>\n\n    <blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n      “People will always say that something that affects their bottom line will be bad, but you have to weigh that against how much it could help the economy and real data detailing how it would affect investors. I completely understand why people would have that concern but until there’s evidence that is the case I am not going to make a decision on it either way.”&nbsp;<br>\n    </blockquote>\n\n  <p>\n    The future of the SDSE remains unwritten, but one thing is crystal clear—it is no longer a side project or an isolated financial experiment. It has become a force within the economy, a system that channels capital, drives investment, and provides opportunities where none existed before.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Only time will tell how our economy will evolve—but one thing is certain: the SDSE plays a crucial role in its growth. The question is no longer whether the SDSE is relevant but how best to harness its potential without stifling its growth. And in that regard, the SDSE has already succeeded—it is no longer a matter of how it will shape the economy, but more so a matter of how far it will go.\n  </p>\n<div><h4>Share article:</h4>\n<center>\n<button onclick=\"copyURL()\">Copy link</button>\n<script>\nfunction copyURL() {\n let url = document.location.href\nnavigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(function() {\n    console.log('Copied!');\n}, function() {\n    console.log('Copy error')\n});\n}\n</script>\n</center>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.commoninja.com/sdk/latest/commonninja.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"commonninja_component pid-bce4f8ea-9bd1-4793-88bc-63467f850c33\"></div></div>",
