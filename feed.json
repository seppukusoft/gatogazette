In the realm of law, navigating that boundary is left to judges, who are admired and promoted for their prowess in understanding and interpreting legislation.<br><br>We trust judges to rely on precedent in most cases, only overturning egregious miscarriages of justice that are often the result of nearsightedness or partisanship. In the ruling of \"In re Appeal of Summary Ban - \"mc_uighilin\" (u/Panzzrr) [2025] SDSC2\" (hereafter \"the Panzzrr case\"), the Supreme Court has overturned a fundamental precedent that has kept SimDemocracy alive as long as it has: the supremacy of the relevant platform's Terms of Service.<br><br>This flawed judgment, made in the name of protecting due process, opens the door for abuse and the death of SimDemocracy.<br><br>Not long ago, the SimDem community celebrated its sixth anniversary—this year's festivities were marked by the massive increase in the citizen population that occurred just a month prior due to the viral video posted by longtime member Danyo (Trolligarch). Then and since, many of the \"older generation\" (i.e. those who were citizens before the most recent immigration wave) noted that SimDem in earlier years was far more permissive of toxic behavior and harassment.<br><br>Some members, such as Toast, look fondly upon that era, but the vast majority of citizens are at least content with the protections in place to prevent that conduct, if not interested in strengthening them. Additionally, the Discord Terms of Service (and, by extension, Community Guidelines) have been strengthened in recent years to prevent harmful conduct such as harassment of marginalized groups, the proliferation of CSAM and misinformation, and hate speech in the form of genocide denial. <br><br>The tools used and care taken on behalf of Discord have improved over the years as it has faced more scrutiny and the \"nuking\" (the complete removal of a server, up to and including the banning of its members) of hateful or otherwise harmful servers is something I've seen only increase in that same period. <br><br>The Supreme Court ruling in the Panzzrr case opens our beloved community up to that same fate.<br><br>In SimDem's history, there have been no small number of people banned under the Discord Terms of Service; many for hate speech in all its forms, but others for issues far more serious—and illegal. I need not elaborate on the specific details of those cases to spare any reader the time and disgust, but the proper course of action is clear: a ban. A final, permanent ban.<br><br>As much as we want to believe that we are a government or nation-state, we are not. We cannot make decisions on cases that risk our place on the platform or lead to criminal records. At a certain point, we must admit that there are \"SimDem crimes\" too serious to permit by allowing the offender to stay on the server for a trial, or even to keep in contact with.<br><br>Every judge, besides those ruling in this case, was well aware of that fact—nay, common sense.<br><br>However, this group of three (themselves not without controversy) have not only rebuked that approach but applied the ruling retroactively. Hundreds of the most vile people to ever \"step foot\" in SimDem are now, according to the Court, constitutionally guaranteed the right to return.<br><br>There has never, in my estimation and that of esteemed citizens far more knowledgeable than I, been a Supreme Court ruling so dangerous or detrimental to our community than this.<br><br>Multiple prominent members, including Danyo himself, who brought so many of us back or introduced us to SimDem for the first time, have already indicated that they no longer wish to remain in the server given the risk of its \"nuking.\" I cannot blame them.<br><br>In fact, although I've had my issues with the server in the past, I (like so many others) have always felt drawn to the community for one reason or another. There has never been a more compelling reason to leave.<br><br>I will not take this space to encourage people to leave immediately, however; instead, I encourage anyone who has read thus far to take action. Push the Senate to pass legislation immediately to overturn the ruling and hold the Supreme Court justices accountable for what is, at its best, a complete lack of foresight and sound judgment.<br><br>If all else fails, then leaving is indeed the only choice left, if only to protect your account.<br><br>Our democracy has not yet died; do not let this opportunity to save it slip away.\n  </p>\n<div><h4>Share article:</h4>\n<center>\n<button onclick=\"copyURL()\">Copy link</button>\n<script>\nfunction copyURL() {\n let url = document.location.href\nnavigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(function() {\n    console.log('Copied!');\n}, function() {\n    console.log('Copy error')\n});\n}\n</script>\n</center>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.commoninja.com/sdk/latest/commonninja.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"commonninja_component pid-bce4f8ea-9bd1-4793-88bc-63467f850c33\"></div>\n</div>",

The SDSE (SimDemocracy Stock Exchange) is an independent project where entrepreneurs and investors can trade public business stocks.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The SDSE was created during a time when the economy was stagnant, lacking the mobility and monetary flux that stable economies rely on, as per the words of u/frisianoutlaw – a major investor and founder of the SDSE.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    With few outlets for spending available, people turned to entrepreneurship and high-risk ventures like gambling, but for those seeking structured, long-term investment opportunities, SDSE provided a new, organized alternative&nbsp;<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The economy is always shifting, reflecting the constant change of power in government leadership and workforce. While new taxation policies have been introduced to stabilize revenue streams, the SDSE remains largely untouched by regulatory oversight. The question now is whether the SDSE can prove itself to become an essential pillar of the economy, or will remain a side project hindered by the various fiscal problems our democracy faces—a question I hope to answer by the end of this article.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    A major detail I pointedly did not mention earlier in my explanation of the SDSE is that the SDSE has, as of the writing of this article, no government regulations imposed on it. Unlike other sources of revenue, which are subject to taxation, such as wages and personal income—the SDSE remains untouched by government oversight.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This regulatory gap is significant because, while taxation and oversight can provide stability, they also introduce friction that discourages investment. SDSE’s current freedom from government intervention gives it a special opportunity to grow dynamically; provided it can gain the public’s trust.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Moreover, this also raises questions about the SDSE’s long-term role in the economy. To explore this point further, let’s consider both the opinions of investors and the insight of the government through its financial policies.\n  </p>\n<div><hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr>\n<center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center>\n<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\" alt=\"\" class=\"ad\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr></div>\n\n  <p>\n    You might believe that the SDSE is too young and undeveloped to rely on or even pursue in terms of financial reserves, but in the eyes of many investors: the SDSE is growing sustainably. Every week, stocks are exchanged and new businesses are listed to the public. This is NOT a call for you to go spend your life savings on stocks; far from it actually, as the stock exchange is misunderstood by many and underplayed.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Nf19_1, a lawyer and investor whom I interviewed for his broad knowledge of the market, believes that the stock exchange is perceived by many as a game of fate. Buy low, sell high—just like the roll of dice; however, Nf19_1 argues that the market follows patterns that need to be analyzed and leveraged. Nf19_1 is also one of the few that recognize the real obstacle that faces the SDSE: financial engagement is not yet an essential part of life.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Stock investments rely on confidence – that is a fact known by many. Where brokers like Nf19_1 identify profitable opportunities in companies like SimDem Today and GatoPoll, other people remain dormant. The lack of public interest in finance means that SDSE’s influence is of limited reach.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    And why is that a problem per se? Without active engagement, the market risks stagnation. This economic stagnation will not only be a failure of the SDSE itself but rather a sign that financial literacy and economic participation must be encouraged.  This is the problem that started the SDSE in the first place and the reason why I stated that it may persist. The challenge, the main obstacle that lies in front, is to connect those who see the value of the SDSE and those who do not.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    What is the role of the government in this? The government’s economic strategy indirectly supports SDSE’s growth by focusing on stability and self-actualization. Recently, the Senate introduced the Government Bond Expansion Act. To spare you the technical details, which you can obtain by reading the Act, this legislation defines the various forms of government bonds provided. By giving the Treasury the ability to issue the different types of bonds at need, this act births a new avenue for investment.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    And how does the SDSE relate to bond expansion? Well, a bond market could integrate seamlessly with the stock exchange. Bonds and stocks are different at their core and they serve different purposes but they provide complementary roles. Bonds provide economic stability, while stocks drive growth.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Markets with both stocks and bonds tend to have more mature economies. For example, in the real world, you have the U.S. Treasury and Wall Street, the London Stock Exchange, and government gilts. Many examples worldwide can prove and assert that bonds and stocks coexisting can enhance a country’s financial stability.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    One might argue that what differentiates us from the examples I gave above is that, in the real world, there is a need for money—there is a desire to obtain money on a large scale that is not present in a simulation. However, that assumption overlooks a crucial factor: the role of structured financial systems in shaping economic behavior.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Even in a simulation of a democracy, where basic survival does not hinge on wealth, incentives, or competition – investment still drives economic activity. The absence of necessity does not eliminate the demand for a stock exchange, it merely transforms it shifting the focus from survival, or what you can perceive as survival, to influence, growth, and financial incentive.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    But is the economy really in such dire need of the stock exchange? To be more clear—how is the economy performing? Is the government able to control and manage its finances in a self-sufficient and efficient manner?\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/kuguk.png\" height=\"530\" width=\"912\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/responsive/kuguk-xs.png 640w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/responsive/kuguk-sm.png 768w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/responsive/kuguk-md.png 1024w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/responsive/kuguk-lg.png 1366w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/responsive/kuguk-xl.png 1600w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/36/responsive/kuguk-2xl.png 1920w\">\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    If we were to describe the data above, it would be clear that the government's accounts are fluctuant in their current state. January saw significant income outweighing spending, but by February the government’s expenses had skyrocketed. March, though incomplete in records, suggests a sharp decline in income revenue.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The structural weaknesses present in the Treasury have been highlighted by both Secretary of Treasury Matt Cheney, and his predecessor, FLY GUY 215, who voiced his thoughts and experiences in a similar article here. The focus of the Treasury at the current time is to lay out the foundation upon which to develop the economy, which is why the SDSE has been left fairly unregulated for the time being.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This may perhaps lead to your question: how can the government integrate the SDSE into the current economic infrastructure? Should the SDSE be regulated? Taxed? Subsidized? Well, not exactly.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    You see, many investors and shareholders—including Loger, founding member of ROSE and major investor of GatoPoll who I interviewed for the research of this article, share a common sentiment in that taxing the stock exchange would lead to negative behavior from investors and may as a consequence halt trading all-together. Loger also believes that there is no need for legislation amidst the current volume of trade.\n  </p>\n<div><hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr>\n<center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center>\n<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\" alt=\"\" class=\"ad\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr></div>\n\n  <p>\n    This raises a significant question: how can the government integrate SDSE into the economy without stifling its growth? The point I’m trying to make is that the investors, like Logan, believe that a poorly implemented or restrictive implementation of legislations and policies is destructive to the stock exchange and the fall of the stock exchange may attribute a large loss in circulation and monetary flow for the economy as a whole.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The Treasury acknowledges the importance of tax reforms and legislation, but insists that they must be based on thorough research and long-term data rather than rushed policies. Implementing policies in a haste would not only cause public distress but also damage the already fragile economic infrastructure currently present.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Secretary of Treasury Matt Cheney has emphasized in an interview that I conducted with him that he will not be making a decision in regards to regulating the SDSE without solid concrete evidence and data that suggests otherwise, stating:\n  </p>\n\n    <blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n      “People will always say that something that affects their bottom line will be bad, but you have to weigh that against how much it could help the economy and real data detailing how it would affect investors. I completely understand why people would have that concern but until there’s evidence that is the case I am not going to make a decision on it either way.”&nbsp;<br>\n    </blockquote>\n\n  <p>\n    The future of the SDSE remains unwritten, but one thing is crystal clear—it is no longer a side project or an isolated financial experiment. It has become a force within the economy, a system that channels capital, drives investment, and provides opportunities where none existed before.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Only time will tell how our economy will evolve—but one thing is certain: the SDSE plays a crucial role in its growth. The question is no longer whether the SDSE is relevant but how best to harness its potential without stifling its growth. And in that regard, the SDSE has already succeeded—it is no longer a matter of how it will shape the economy, but more so a matter of how far it will go.\n  </p>\n<div><h4>Share article:</h4>\n<center>\n<button onclick=\"copyURL()\">Copy link</button>\n<script>\nfunction copyURL() {\n let url = document.location.href\nnavigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(function() {\n    console.log('Copied!');\n}, function() {\n    console.log('Copy error')\n});\n}\n</script>\n</center>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.commoninja.com/sdk/latest/commonninja.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"commonninja_component pid-bce4f8ea-9bd1-4793-88bc-63467f850c33\"></div></div>",

Those fears are not unfounded; the number of voters participating in each election has been steadily decreasing and Syndicality has begun looking for help, especially after the 135th Senate had two by-elections in just as many days after the main election.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Many have also complained about the constant campaigning necessary in the current system which leads to users being inundated with ads.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    To remedy those issues, some have suggestions extending the terms for those positions from 2 weeks to 4, putting us on a 2-week alternating schedule that allows for more time to set up ballots and some downtime from campaigning.\n  </p>\n<div><hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr>\n<center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center>\n<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\" alt=\"\" class=\"ad\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr></div>\n\n  <p>\n    To see how popular such a system would be, we administered a sponsored poll that separately asked respondents whether they would support a 4-week term for the presidency and Senate.\n  </p>\n\n  <div  class=\"gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--wide\">\n    <div class=\"gallery\" data-columns=\"2\">\n      <figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/34/gallery/Do-you-support-extending-each-presidential-term-to-4-weeks-from-the-current-2_.png\" data-size=\"600x371\">\n        <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/34/gallery/Do-you-support-extending-each-presidential-term-to-4-weeks-from-the-current-2_-thumbnail.png\" height=\"371\" width=\"600\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      \n    </figure><figure class=\"gallery__item\">\n      <a href=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/34/gallery/Do-you-support-extending-each-senatorial-term-to-4-weeks-from-the-current-2_.png\" data-size=\"600x371\">\n        <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/34/gallery/Do-you-support-extending-each-senatorial-term-to-4-weeks-from-the-current-2_-thumbnail.png\" height=\"371\" width=\"600\" alt=\"\" >\n      </a>\n      \n    </figure>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <p>\n    The results were surprising; while support for extending the presidential term was nearly equal to opposition to the plan, a slight majority of respondents (52.8%) are against the extension.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    in contrast, the public is somewhat more against extending senators' terms to 4 weeks, with 59% of respondents expressing opposition.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Both results show that SimDem is pretty neatly divided on the issue of extending these terms and it may come down to campaigning for either side to tip the scales.\n  </p>\n<div><h4>Share article:</h4>\n<center>\n<button onclick=\"copyURL()\">Copy link</button>\n<script>\nfunction copyURL() {\n let url = document.location.href\nnavigator.clipboard.writeText(url).then(function() {\n    console.log('Copied!');\n}, function() {\n    console.log('Copy error')\n});\n}\n</script>\n</center>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<script src=\"https://cdn.commoninja.com/sdk/latest/commonninja.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"commonninja_component pid-bce4f8ea-9bd1-4793-88bc-63467f850c33\"></div>\n</div>",

They had the idea to create the party actually but wanted me to be the figurehead.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>You joined the SimDem server and near-immediately made a lengthy post about ROSE and QQQ. Since you're so new but commenting on old drama, many have accused you of being an alt. What is your official comment on those accusations?&nbsp;</b><br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I joined this server with one goal, to call out ROSE and their long history of wrecking SimDemocracy. The fact that some are scrambling to label me an \"alt\" instead of addressing what I’m saying only proves how desperate they are to dodge the truth. I’ve done my research and I’ve talked to the people who lived through the chaos the QQQ caused, and I’m not here to play along with their revisionist history. If my presence shakes them, maybe they should take a hard look at why.\n<br>\n\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Let's get something straight. I’m far from the only one who sees through ROSE’s lies. Plenty of long-time SimDemocracy members have been harassed, sabotaged, and targeted by these same people, and now ROSE wants everyone to forget about it. We will not allow this to happen. These people spent days attacking anyone who stood in their way, and now they want to hide behind another shell party for their failure of the original. But no matter how much they try to deflect, they don’t get to erase what they’ve done. We will not allow them to erase what they have done.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>ROSE have defended themselves by noting that the QQQ members with a history of slur usage and/or harassment (ex. Domina, Kassady, etc.) are not in ROSE and, in fact, no longer in the server. Given this, why is the TVDP continuing its attacks on ROSE?</b>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    ROSE can claim they’ve cut ties with QQQ’s worst offenders, but their actions tell a different story. They still harbor figures like Decatherinated/High Show. Harboring isn't even the right word since they basically lead the party. They've caused direct harm to TVDP members and perhaps did not participate in the same slur usage as other members but vehemently defended those who did. If they truly wanted a fresh start, they wouldn’t keep those who embody the same toxicity they claim to reject. The TVDP isn’t attacking ROSE, we’re holding them accountable for their hypocrisy and ongoing attempts to undermine order in SimDemocracy.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>To clarify, are you asserting that Decatherinated and High Show are the same person or simply both are leading the party?</b>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Same person.\n  </p>\n<div><hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr>\n<center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center>\n<br>\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\" alt=\"\" class=\"ad\" data-is-external-image=\"true\">\n<hr class=\"separator separator--dots\"></hr></div>\n\n  <p>\n    <b>What is your evidence for that accusation?</b>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This is technically circumstantial evidence, but the timing and sequence of events raise serious suspicions. Given the close range of server join dates between Decautherinated [<i>sic</i>]&nbsp;and High Show, we believe there is a strong likelihood that High Show is, in fact, an alternate account created to bypass the consequences of Decautherinated’s  [<i>sic</i>] actions.\n<br>\n<br>Decautherinated [<i>sic</i>] was fully aware of the illegality of her future actions days before committing them, which ultimately led to her arrest. The sudden appearance of High Show, closely following these events, suggests an intentional effort to evade the judicial system and continue participation in SimDem under a different identity. The behavioral patterns, engagement style, and political involvement of High Show align too closely with those of Decautherinated [<i>sic</i>] for this to be dismissed as mere coincidence.\n<br>\n<br>Given these factors, we strongly suspect that High Show is an alt account created to allow Decautherinated [<i>sic</i>] to re-enter SimDem’s political sphere despite her ban. This represents not only a subversion of justice but a deliberate attempt to manipulate the system while avoiding accountability.\n  </p>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--long-line\" />\n<pre class=\" language-html\"><code>We reached out to Blanche (High Show) and Decatherinated for comment on these allegations. They simultaneously refuted \"this nonsense in the strongest terms\" and highlighted their transparency, while noting that Decatherinated has been in the server as early as 2022 and is, in fact, not banned.\n\nIn addition, they requested that the following images be offered for confirmation of that fact with attached captions for context.\n\nThe interview continues below the images.</code></pre>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/image.png\" height=\"79\" width=\"913\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/image-xs.png 640w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/image-sm.png 768w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/image-md.png 1024w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/image-lg.png 1366w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/image-xl.png 1600w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/image-2xl.png 1920w\">\n      <figcaption>Both responded to our questions simultaneously.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172005-2.png\" height=\"250\" width=\"569\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172005-2-xs.png 640w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172005-2-sm.png 768w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172005-2-md.png 1024w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172005-2-lg.png 1366w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172005-2-xl.png 1600w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172005-2-2xl.png 1920w\">\n      <figcaption>Blanche (High Show) participating in another server before Decatherinated's account was even created, with a forwarded message as proof.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172110.png\" height=\"427\" width=\"232\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172110-xs.png 640w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172110-sm.png 768w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172110-md.png 1024w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172110-lg.png 1366w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172110-xl.png 1600w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/Screenshot-2025-02-21-172110-2xl.png 1920w\">\n      <figcaption>Decatherinated's profile, with the date of her account creation in March 2022 highlighted.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/aefwef.png\" height=\"768\" width=\"1229\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/aefwef-xs.png 640w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/aefwef-sm.png 768w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/aefwef-md.png 1024w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/aefwef-lg.png 1366w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/aefwef-xl.png 1600w ,https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/26/responsive/aefwef-2xl.png 1920w\">\n      <figcaption>An (admittedly inebriated) Decatherinated insisted this image from April 2022 showing her custom Hearthstone card designs in another server be included.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n<hr class=\"separator separator--long-line\" />\n\n  <p>\n    <b>You've also overseen the construction of a list of enemies or \"adversaries\" outside of those in ROSE.
