  <p>
    The poll was conducted by asking respondents to indicate approval, disapproval, or neutrality/unfamiliarity with each of the 13 current senators. After collecting 25 responses, the data was weighted to match the current party distribution (based on the data found <a href="https://discord.com/channels/554769523635650580/1028627919993585745/1331761906024976477" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1"  >here</a>).

  <p>
    The results show that the senators generally have positive reputations; all but the three least popular senators have a <b>disapproval rate of less than 15%</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <b>average approval rate was 31.5%</b> and the <b>average disapproval rate was 13.6%</b>, making the <b>average net approval rate</b> for the current Senate <b>+17.9%</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This data does show that a great deal of people are either unaware of certain senators or neutral in their opinions. The average response rate of "Neutral/Unsure" is 54.9%; unsurprisingly, the senators who received the least of that response were those at the extremes, such as Sens. Ppatpat (C) and Kelvin (FBP), but it should be noted that Sens. Cheez (LP), Eleanor (QQQ), AI Philosophy (SPQR), and Dylan (USL) have neutral response rates of <b>over 65%</b>, with Sen. Eleanor being the most neutral/obscure senator with <b>nearly 75%</b> of respondents choosing that option for her.
  </p>

  <p>
    In short, while the majority of senators are popular and have net approval ratings, most need to expand their profiles across the voter base or improve their reputations to improve them beyond neutrality.

  </p>


  <p>
    The majority of current citizens are unaware of the previous attempts due to over 80% of server members having only joined in the last 3 weeks—a fact that the former CLP are using to their advantage. In past years, members of the "Civil Liberties Party" have colluded to attempt to overthrow the government or replace the judiciary with supporters on <i>several</i>&nbsp;occasions. The allegations made in the recently-dropped charges are only the tip of the iceberg. Additionally, members have previously contributed to a toxic atmosphere, even working together to harass political opponents or people who simply disagreed with them.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    As Halfcat noted in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/554769523635650580/1028641820093202532/1331418552917557318" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1"  >his statement</a>, the CLP's plan to take over last time involved "creat[ing] a new party, with a friendlier face that claimed to fight for the rights of new people. They would then replace the judiciary with people loyal to them, and finally replace the Supervisors so that there would be no one left to stop them."
  </p>

  <p>
    The charges against Kelvin and others were based on allegations of a conspiracy to make alternate accounts ("alts") to flood the server, elect a friendly president, and solidify their power by attacking and replacing the judiciary. This, if true, would be clearly illegal—the use of alts in this manner (both to vote multiple times and, in Mooklyn's case, evade a ban) is prohibited by the Constitution and Criminal Code.
  </p>

  <p>
    In co-opting the "New People's Party," however, they found a solution to that issue: by taking advantage of the SimDem population roughly quintupling in the span of a week, they could create a powerful party with support from real voters who were completely unaware of their previous actions. <b>Gone was the illegal element of their scheme and, with it, the potential for obstruction.</b>
  </p>

  <p>
    The steps to achieve their goals are already in motion. Kelvin, who is part of the ex-CLP aligned "Fucking Best Party" and was a CLP member involved in previous unfavorable activities himself, has recently proposed <a href="https://discord.com/channels/554769523635650580/1029786104397824131/1331389788816670791" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1"  >a new law</a> in the Senate that increases executive powers and makes it easier to remove judges and supervisors, the two groups best equipped to prevent a power grab.
  </p>

  <p>
    Given the history of such attempts by prominent members of the FBP and NPP, it is reasonable to fear that this is the beginning of another shot. What's most disheartening, however, is the lack of action against those who have allegedly committed the highest crime in the server. The dropping of all charges was a major blow to public confidence in the government, affecting both the AG's office and the only-recently elected President Imade.
  </p>

  <p>
    This low-stakes democracy simulation online has been successful for nearly 6 years due to the potential for participants to experience politics, friendship, and fun in one place. The sim has survived through tough times due to the tenacity of its members and the rules and norms that guide it. However, as Halfcat so neatly put it, "when the crime of trying to destroy SimDemocracy isn’t punished, then none of that other stuff matters. <b>It’s no longer fun, because there is no point.</b>"
  </p>

  <p>
    Without fun, without a point, what is there to gain or lose? There can be no enjoyment if the core of the community is destroyed, tossed aside to boost the egos of a select few through exerting their power in a Discord server.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    We must not allow these destroyers "victory over the barren wasteland" because doing so accepts that SimDem is destined to become barren. SimDem has never been more popular and to squander such an opportunity would be a catastrophic loss. After all, we are just beginning to feel the effects of the catastrophic loss of Halfcat, an influential and frankly indispensable member of our community, and he is only one person. <b>The loss of our community, even of our recognition of it, must be avoided at all costs.</b>
  </p>

  <p>
    For these reasons, we <b>must</b> take every opportunity to oppose the power grab legislation, the political influence of the suspect members, and any other attempts to harm SimDemocracy. As much as Halfcat's departure affects us, we <b>must</b> carry on by ensuring that his posts are filled with people dedicated to the health of the server, not partisan games and power plays. We <b>must</b> ensure that toxicity and corruption do not become commonplace and push more people away. Finally, we <b>must</b> push for further investigation into the actions behind the dropped charges and improve public confidence in our government.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Resistance at all levels is the only way to keep SimDem as it should be: fun, not failed.</b>

  <p>
    <b>Would you like to begin by introducing yourself to voters who may not be familiar with you?
</b><br>
<br>Let me speak simple: I am Max. I am running for senate. I do not believe the current senators are doing a good job, nor do I believe they have been completely transparent, honest, or well-intentioned with their actions. I’ll promise you this—I’ll never tell you a lie, not in my campaign, nor my Senate tenure if I may be blessed with one. That is the biggest issue, trust. I think it’s time to turn a new page, away from scandal, That is why I’m running to be your senator.
<br>
<br><b>What would you say is your flagship policy?
</b><br>
<br>I would say a bicameral legislature would be one of my MOST important policy plans[.]
<br><br><b>What is your plan to implement a bicameral legislature? How would each house be set up and what would their powers be?
</b><br>
<br>I believe the senate size should be reduced so that there is more of a use to a lower house. Additionally, 19 senators (which are how many are accepted currently) are way too much, even factoring in the fact 32 or so candidates are running (more than half!). The proposition for a lower amount, which was made by a member whose name I will not speak, comes off to me as very acceptable. As for the lower chamber, I’m thinking something like the “House of Delegates” to give a member of that lower house a proper name. Furthermore, I believe this HoD should have at least 4-7 members, following a similar formula to the senate. I strongly believe in a lower chamber because they can provide checks and balances to the senate, which can come in handy when the Executive branch cannot or will not. Also, I would like to mention that I agree with fellow candidate Lucas that a lower house would allow for more representation.
<br><br><b>A recent poll showed that the issues that the voters cared most about when choosing a candidate to support were (in order) "improving the economy/increasing its use," "senate expansion," and "increasing government efficiency."
<br>First, how do you square your support for a bicameral legislature with the popular demand for simply expanding the Senate?
<br>Second, what are your positions on the other two issues?
</b><br>
<br>First off, if I may combine two issues. A bicameral legislature would actually streamline the government, by blocking some of the more extreme bills the current Senate would paas, and some of the more extreme bills the lower chamber may pass. If anything, it’d allow for a better, faster way for bills to be signed without having to worry about specific contents of the bill. Furthermore, a second legislature would stop a group of senators to just vote the same way to pass the laws they want, and would make the Congress (referring to both this hypothetical lower house and senate) be in line with public interest[.]
<br>Second off, the economys[sic] a very, very tricky thing to handle. To increase productivity, I would like to suggest some sort of commodities/goods system in which one can spend their money. However, the specifics of this I do not know, and no one else seems to have come up with anything, except Biscuit, who suggested this. I would say I am inclined to support this considering we have no other use for our money anyways.
<br>As for government efficiency, I am a huge proponent of streamlining the executive branch, and I am an opponent for bureaucratic measures like Executive Senators, which demonstrates an unfair breachment of the seperation of the Legislative and Executive branches. President Imade’s actions to streamline the departments have been amazing and I commend them for their work on the executive branch, and hope to see more. Targeted knockouts and removals of certain branches, channels are imperative for a server thats easy to navigate. I remember when I first joined and couldn’t understand a thing, so I went straight to general.
<br><br><b>Are there any other views or policies you want the public to know about?
</b><br>
<br>I would like the public to know that we do not have to live like this, with this senate. The senate has taken our trust and thrown it out of the window, making provate deals without the public’s interest taken into account. I will be a different Senator, and I promise to never lie during my campaign and tenure[.]
<br><br><b>Finally, if you could summarize your campaign in a single word, what would it be?
</b><br>
<br>Trust.

  <ul>
    <li>Among members of the <b>SDPB</b> coalition and aligned independents, Question 1 has <b>~73% support</b>, just barely above the 66.6% needed to pass.</li><li>As for members of the <b>Unity coalition</b> and aligned independents, support for Question 1 is much stronger <b>at ~86%</b>, well above the threshold for passage.</li><li>When considering all <b>independents and members of small parties</b>, Question 1 has <b>60% support</b>, indicating that this group is <b>not as interested in expanding the Senate</b> (at least in this manner) as the main coalitions are. This is likely due to them <b>not having the level of support</b> that the large parties and blocs have.<br></li>

    <b>Question 2</b>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <b>SDPB</b> and aligned independents are nearly split in half over whether to pass Question 2, with <b>~55% voting against it</b>.</li><li>The <b>Unity coalition</b> and aligned independents, however, are strongly against Question 2, with <b>~86% voting against it</b>, mirroring the percentage of votes in favor of Question 1.</li><li>In contrast to both major coalitions, <b>independents and small parties</b> voted overwhelmingly in favor of Question 2, with <b>70% supporting the amendment</b>. This points to a distinction between independents and party members: <b>independent candidates stand to gain the most</b> from this since, if a popular independent just misses out on a seat and a seat ends up vacant, they could have a chance to take that seat for the rest of the term. This is in contrast to a party list system which would guarantee vacant seats to members of the party whose seat was vacated.</li>
