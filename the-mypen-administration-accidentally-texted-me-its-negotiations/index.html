Since these statements came from respected members of the community, and were not dispelled by agency heads such as SDBI Director Fede, they became the prevailing narrative surrounding the case.<br></p><p>Yesterday (as of the writing of this article), the two were released without charge. Considering the public's understanding of the situation, many citizens expressed concern with their release.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/Screenshot-2025-04-10-013423.png" height="302" width="571" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-013423-xs.png 640w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-013423-sm.png 768w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-013423-md.png 1024w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-013423-lg.png 1366w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-013423-xl.png 1600w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-013423-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>In an unofficial poll conducted by Treasury Secretary Logry in #general-announcements after their release was announced, nearly 40% of respondents indicated that they did not support the charges against Myth and Notcom being dropped.</p><p>With such a substantial amount of concern about potential doxxers and traitors escaping justice, it would be equally concerning if those allegations were not, and had never been, true.</p><p>The Gazette can confirm that the allegations made against Myth and Notcom range from wildly exaggerated to completely fabricated and are the tip of an iceberg of governmental incompetence and backroom deals.</p><p>How can the Gazette speak so authoritatively on the subject?

Whether Myth should have been released or not was never even in dispute. The main concern was their oversight of Notcom, whose actions were more tangible.</p><p>However, even Notcom's actions were minor. It came to light, through these negotiations, that Notcom's dangerous and feared leak of information was the post of a single screenshot of a TIDE channel in SimDem #general.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/Screenshot-2025-04-10-033655.png" height="1102" width="601" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-033655-xs.png 640w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-033655-sm.png 768w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-033655-md.png 1024w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-033655-lg.png 1366w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-033655-xl.png 1600w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-033655-2xl.png 1920w"><figcaption>The screenshot in question.</figcaption></figure><p>A single screenshot.</p><p>Did the screenshot compromise any OHS agents? Nope.<br>Did it even reveal any TIDE associates that weren't known or at least widely suspected? No again.</p><p>All it did was confirm what many suspected: Guava (jvpjvp54545) is a member of TIDE.</p><p>It should be noted that Guava was once publicly a TIDE member, but he has since repeatedly stated that he left over a month ago, after the illegal actions by TIDE began. This screenshot, and other data gathered by the Gazette proves this is false; Guava is not only an active member, but is contributing to their efforts through ownership of a bot, likely the OVERWATCH bot.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/Screenshot-2025-04-10-034250.png" height="921" width="563" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-034250-xs.png 640w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-034250-sm.png 768w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-034250-md.png 1024w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-034250-lg.png 1366w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-034250-xl.png 1600w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-10-034250-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>From another source, we've learned that Guava is not only TIDE's Director of Intelligence, but its Vice Chairman.

What is the New Vegas server evidence?"</p><p>That's where this story gets even deeper.</p><h5 id="part-ii-war-never-changes" class="align-center">Part II: War Never Changes</h5><p>Nf19 was a user who quickly became known for shaking things up—for better or worse. After joining in late February, he took the bar exam and started a lucrative business as a defense attorney for some of SimDem's most controversial members, from alleged slur spammers to sexual harassers.&nbsp;</p><p>Although some may find such a job immoral, defense attorneys for all crimes are a necessary part of our justice system, and Nf19 was considered one of the most dedicated to his clients. However, due to his profession and his actions outside of court (such as many repeated attempts to encourage people to invest in his business ventures under suspicious circumstances), he was a polarizing figure.</p><p>Despite this, he climbed the ranks of the government, becoming involved with the DOJ and State Department, even serving as an ambassador to the Republic of Julia. Yet, without warning, on March 30, 2025, he left all SimDem-affiliated servers, leaving his legal clients and shares of stock behind.</p><p>At the same time, unbeknownst to the public, the OHS had a massive problem—there was a mole.</p><p>On March 23, 2025, TIDE leader Barbacue revealed to the group's members that he gained access to a "TIDE watchlist" allegedly belonging to OHS. Guava, as TIDE Vice Chairman but still posing as an ex-TIDE member in SimDem, forwarded the information to then-OHS Director Notcom to confirm its validity. Notcom played it off, assuring Guava that it was a fabrication meant to lure him back into TIDE. It wasn't.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/Screenshot-2025-04-11-035305.png" height="1303" width="1068" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-11-035305-xs.png 640w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-11-035305-sm.png 768w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-11-035305-md.png 1024w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-11-035305-lg.png 1366w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-11-035305-xl.png 1600w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-11-035305-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>Recognizing the gravity of the situation, Notcom took swift action: all of the OHS's intelligence on TIDE was removed from SimDem and quarantined in a server titled "New vegas fan club," in reference to the game <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. Notcom then invited only the few closest OHS agents he knew could be trusted and began to investigate who was leaking information to TIDE.</p><p>Noting that the document leaked was only shared between OHS and DOJ, within 24 hours the mole was determined to be Nf19. However, no action was taken to remove Nf19 so as to not give away that OHS was onto him. The leaks stopped and, within days, Nf19 left of his own accord.</p><p>This New Vegas server, although it may have succeeded in its original goal, created a dilemma; when Notcom resigned as OHS Director a week after Nf19's departure, he transferred the role to Mythrows, along with ownership of the server. That same day, Notcom (and shortly later Myth) were arrested on the (previously-debunked) charges, as outlined in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FneGhAHzjxlwLtp9HRUxbteb1GjjOu7xswycAxwXng4/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1">document written and signed by newly-elected President Mypen</a>.</p><p>So, the stage was set: Myth and Notcom had full control of the server which held all of the OHS's intelligence from the investigations into TIDE and other threats, and they were just arrested on charges they knew were exaggerated or outright false. Believing that the Mypen administration was fully aware of the illegality of their arrests, they chose to use the only leverage they had—they took the server hostage.</p><p>For a time, chaos was in control of the administration; the OHS couldn't continue their investigations into TIDE without the evidence they had already gathered, the DOJ lost access to the evidence for planned and ongoing charges, and SDIOA lacked its oversight access to a critical part of SimDem's inner systems.</p><p>In a particularly shocking moment, when this publication attempted to file <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gBSEyYeBpA8wYMF_cQ06_OFB3dsUDnW7JnvSOYMz_dQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1">a FOIA request</a> for access to Operation Kashmir (PUP counter-intelligence) documents, we were told that the relevant agencies could not provide <i>any&nbsp;documents</i>, confidential or not, because they simply had none.</p><p>That leverage was enough to bring the Mypen administration to the negotiating table, the result of which was described at the start of this piece. However, the story doesn't end there; soon after the deal was finalized and Notcom and Myth were freed, there were rumblings that Mypen intended to go back on the deal and dissolve the OHS anyway. This, combined with animosity by Governor Lucas and MBH in the aftermath of their release (based on the incomplete information the public had at the time) led Myth to refuse to hand over the server.</p><p>In that time, the Gazette unexpectedly gained access to a great deal of information—the entire server's contents were visible. For a short few hours, this publication had more access to the government's documents than the government itself. Although that access was quickly revoked and the server soon given to the administration, it sent the scope of our investigation ballooning.<br><br>The next article in this series, which will hopefully be published in the next 24 hours, will cover some of the important information we learned through our access and various separate leaks that the public needs to know.&nbsp;</p><p>Who is really behind TIDE? What was TIDE's plan for the stock market? Why was Toast banned from Discord? Are there other TIDE alts in SimDem? And, most importantly:</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/Screenshot-2025-04-11-041030.png" height="58" width="368" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-11-041030-xs.png 640w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-11-041030-sm.png 768w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-11-041030-md.png 1024w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-11-041030-lg.png 1366w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-11-041030-xl.png 1600w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/44/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-11-041030-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>We'll be in touch soon.</p><div><h4>Share article:</h4><center><button onclick="copyURL()">Copy link</button><script>function copyURL() {
