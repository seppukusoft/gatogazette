These screenshots show that despite being aware of SDIOA's limited purview regarding charges (i.e. recommending but not pursuing), its employees are (possibly illegally) working with the DOJ to pursue charges on multiple officials.</p><p>These efforts include massive, simultaneous arrests (as was seen yesterday with Notcom and Myth, which are planned to continue) and using SDIOA employees' rights as private citizens to bring criminal cases that the previous AG declined to pursue.</p><p>The process of preparing for this moment goes back at least two weeks when SDIOA began investigating Operation Shanghai, a previously unknown OHS operation to gain intelligence on TIDE members through the use of double agents. SDIOA Investigator Terak completed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dCEyLi2cbxGPUuSnegmIlsGS33fK71es/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1">the EX 01/2025 report</a> on April 8th, but the report was not released until late on the 15th, a full week later.</p><p>The delay of its release was strange, but not necessarily suspicious—that is, until the Gazette learned of the reason behind it.</p><p>The SDIOA released its report at 10:15 pm EDT, which concerned the OHS and SDAF's work on Operation Shanghai, but <a href="https://discord.com/channels/554769523635650580/1361872857080139998" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1">former OHS Director Mythrows</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/554769523635650580/1361883247444889712" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1">former OHS Director Notcom</a>, and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/554769523635650580/1361883169938342079" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1">Secretary of Defense Strix</a> were all arrested between 9:16 and 9:57 pm, before the report recommending charges against them was released.</p><p>Since arrest results in an immediate mute, the public has no basis for understanding why so many people were arrested in such a short time, and those arrested have no opportunity to explain themselves to the public or defend themselves in the court of public opinion.<br></p><p>This was not a coincidence, however, and we now have proof to back that up.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/48/Screenshot-2025-04-17-005746.png" height="749" width="1067" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/48/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-17-005746-xs.png 640w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/48/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-17-005746-sm.png 768w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/48/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-17-005746-md.png 1024w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/48/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-17-005746-lg.png 1366w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/48/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-17-005746-xl.png 1600w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/48/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-17-005746-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>The above message details AG Ben's plan to investigate those involved in Operation Shanghai and charge them, including:</p><ul><li>arresting them before any public reports or criminal complaints</li><li>fully muting the arrestees ("without holding cell perms")</li><li>charging them simultaneously</li><li>emptying the docket to move the charges to trial as quickly as possible</li><li>collaborating with SDIOA to "help" an investigation</li></ul><p>Now, there are many revelations in this message from the two days before the plan went into motion; first, President Mypen is named here rather than Strix for reasons unclear, and AG Ben is specifically compelling SDIOA to investigate the president.</p><div><hr class="separator separator--dots"><center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center><br><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="" alt="" class="ad" data-is-external-image="true"><hr class="separator separator--dots"></div><p>Next, Mythrows is named as someone to be charged in relation to Shanghai, but Myth was eventually charged on allegations of hate speech that most citizens have concluded was satirical. It is also unclear why Myth was charged in this way; it is entirely possible that since the SDIOA report, and subsequent DOJ investigation, revealed nothing worthy of criminal charges from them, they chose to pursue the hate speech allegations while still treating them the same as members alleged to have committed treason or obstruction of justice.</p><p>Additionally, although <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ksKHd-ybkkCZzzQqnyAZXCA_vdx7guMO2NXvdi09f7I/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.lghxvnpk5yas" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1">Myth's warrant has been publicly released</a> (which is how citizens have been able to see the allegedly hateful comments), the warrants for Notcom and Strix's arrests have not.</p><p>Below we have provided a copy of Notcom's warrant for public viewing of the reasons and evidence for his arrest:<br><br></p><div><style>.pdf {

Typically, a warrant is filed by the DOJ to be signed by a separate judge, with the DOJ attorney recusing themselves if they are a judge; only in cases where the AG is also a judge and <i>all other judges</i>&nbsp;decline or recuse themselves is this allowed to happen.</p><p>So, although it is legal, the fact that all judges chose not to sign the warrant except the one who filed it in the first place could indicate that the other judges either had conflicts of interest (which AG Ben clearly had as well) or did not believe in the merits of the evidence. The full warrant can be read below:<br><br></p><div><iframe loading="lazy" class="pdf" src="https://media.gatogazette.com/mythrows_(353340327341588482)_warrant_request.pdf" width="800" height="500"></iframe></div><p>The final thing of note in AG Ben's message is that he believes that the SDIOA can file charges and that the DOJ can collaborate on an investigation with SDIOA. However, a review of relevant statutes by the Gazette has found no evidence of this being true, and a legal expert we contacted confirmed that the AG's interpretation is incorrect.</p><p>In fact, SDIOA liaison MBH told AG Ben as much in the following message:<br></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/48/image-37.png" height="335" width="1060" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/48/responsive/image-37-xs.png 640w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/48/responsive/image-37-sm.png 768w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/48/responsive/image-37-md.png 1024w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/48/responsive/image-37-lg.png 1366w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/48/responsive/image-37-xl.png 1600w, https://gatogazette.com/media/posts/48/responsive/image-37-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>This exchange not only confirms the delay of the report was done intentionally by SDIOA at the AG's request, but also shows that the SDIOA-assigned liaison believed that that was the extent to which they could collaborate with the DOJ. After all, the SDIOA is an independent oversight body meant to investigate, not assist, government agencies.</p><div><hr class="separator separator--dots"><center><h6>Advertisement</h6></center><br><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="" alt="" class="ad" data-is-external-image="true"><hr class="separator separator--dots"></div><p>In that message, however, MBH also notes "personal" help; this is in reference to Ben's lamentation over previously dropping the treason case against Notcom for the leak of a single screenshot, <a href="https://gatogazette.com/the-mypen-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-negotiations/" target="_blank">as we covered previously</a>.</p><p>Typically, the DOJ charges and pursues all criminal cases; however, the <a href="https://qwrky.dev/mediawiki/index.php/Court_Room_Procedures_Act" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1">Courtroom Procedures Act (CPA)</a> allows for a private citizen to file a criminal complaint against someone if the DOJ has declined to file charges. MBH's personal contribution was to draft a complaint to privately charge Notcom under <a href="https://qwrky.dev/mediawiki/index.php/Criminal_Code_2020#Article_48._Revealing_State_Secrets" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-1">Article 48 of the Criminal Code</a>, "Revealing State Secrets."</p><p>The Gazette has obtained a copy of the draft complaint which can be seen below:<br><br></p><div><iframe loading="lazy" class="pdf" src="https://media.gatogazette.com/mbh292_v._notcommunist366.pdf" width="800" height="500"></iframe></div><p>All of these efforts are a part of a larger, heretofore unknown operation involving members of the DOJ, SDIOA, SDBI, and CRB codenamed Operation Mar-a-Lago, a reference to the resort owned by President Trump in Palm Beach, Florida.</p><p>This operation, which includes all of the previously discussed actions, has the ultimate goal of punishing those involved with Operation Shanghai, including people not named in the SDIOA report.&nbsp;</p><p>To that end, AG Ben intends to file a criminal complaint against the group, which the Gazette has obtained and can be read in full below:</p><p>[removed due to DOJ request]</p><p>The complaint charges Strix with "Obstruction of Justice" and Notcom with "conspiracy to commit Obstruction of Justice" for the actions described in the SDIOA report, but goes on to charge former President Muggy and the unidentified "Military Asset" (henceforth "MA") with conspiracy, while tacking on an additional charge of "Terms of Service violation" for MA.</p><p>These latter charges, which have not yet been filed, allege that Muggy's approval of the plan to promote MA to assist him in gaining TIDE's trust as a double agent "shows complicity in the [criminal] conduct," while MA's direct involvement is unclear from the complaint.</p><p>The DOJ intends to pursue a 1000t fine and one-month mute for each defendant, with an additional one-day ban for MA.</p><div><h4>Share article:</h4><center><button onclick="copyURL()">Copy link</button><script>function copyURL() {
