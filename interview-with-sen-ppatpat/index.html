Ppatpat's profile picture.</figcaption></figure><hr class="separator separator--dots"><pre id="test" class="line-numbers language-html"><code>The interview transcript has been edited for grammar, but is otherwise unedited.</code></pre><h5 id="what-motivated-you-to-seek-another-term-in-the-senate" class="align-center">What motivated you to seek another term in the Senate?</h5><p>Well, I had actually been grappling with the question of whether I should seek a second term for a while.<br><br>I had been speaking with my closest colleagues in the senate, mypen and Niko, about whether our time contributing to SimDem was over. I guess part of me felt a bit of burnout, I had gotten all my major legislation passed. However, I realised that there’s still work to be done. In my first term, I focused on building a foundation for reform—whether it was spearheading the SimDem Independent Oversight Authority Act to ensure accountability, passing the Freedom of Information Act to bring transparency, or crafting amendments like the By-elections Act and changes to the Senate Procedures Act to strengthen our democratic processes.<br></p><p>I’ve been present for every vote, engaged in every debate, and committed to being a steady hand during times of change. But, ultimately, I talked to constituents and realised there's still more to be done; like I said in my announcement, the real question that I asked myself was, can I still give this job everything I have? The day I can’t is the day I step aside. That day is not today. There’s still progress to be made, and I want to continue being a part of it.<br><br>Ultimately, win or lose, I'm incredibly proud of the work I've done in my term as a senator. I hope I've not let anybody down. Nonetheless, I'm sure there are those who think I haven't done a good job, and I'd like to hear from them to see where I can improve.<br><br>Today may have been good, but I'll push to do better tomorrow. I think this is something SimDem should also aspire to.<br></p><h5 id="what-are-your-goals-for-the-next-term-if-elected" class="align-center">What are your goals for the next term, if elected?</h5><p>My goals for the next term are clear: to build on the progress we’ve made while tackling the challenges we still face. I want to ensure that SimDemocracy’s institutions remain strong, transparent, and accountable.<br><br>Secondly, I want to focus on economic policies that promote activity and fairness.<br><br>Finally, I want to continue being a steady hand in the Senate—present for every debate, every vote, and every decision. Because good governance doesn’t just happen; it takes commitment, pragmatism, and a willingness to listen.</p><p>For specific plans, I envision a system where private businesses and individuals can compete transparently for government contracts, ensuring fair competition and delivering value to SimDemocracy. This would provide new economic opportunities while holding contractors accountable for delivering quality work on time.<br><br>I also have ideas to to maintain the integrity of our judicial system. I have plans for a bill that formally separates the prosecutorial arm of the DoJ from executive interference. While the attorney general will continue to provide oversight, decisions about prosecutions will rest with an independent board or division within the DoJ, insulated from political pressures. This will prevent any administration from using the DoJ as a political tool and ensure that justice is administered fairly and impartially.</p><h5 id="what-are-your-views-on-the-ongoing-tensions-with-vod-and-foreign-policy-in-general" class="align-center">What are your views on the ongoing tensions with VoD and foreign policy in general?</h5><p>Foreign policy isn’t a straight line—it’s a chessboard with about five games going on at once, and some of the pieces don’t even know they’re part of the game.<br><br>The tensions here? They’re about power, resources, influence—all the usual suspects. But here’s the thing: you don’t solve this by saber-rattling or by retreating into isolation. You solve it by bringing people to the table. Diplomacy is hard, messy, and slow, but it’s the best tool we’ve got.<br><br>Now, foreign policy in general? It’s about values as much as it’s about strategy. It’s about deciding what kind of country we want to be and then making sure the world knows it. Do we want to be the community that leads with strength but tempers it with humility? Or do we want to be the community that throws its weight around without thinking about the consequences? I know which one I’d choose.<br><br>And let me tell you something else—foreign policy doesn’t exist in a vacuum. What we do abroad reflects who we are at home. So, if we’re not taking care of things here—our people, our economy, our principles—then all the foreign policy in the world won’t matter. We’ve got to lead by example, plain and simple.</p><h5 id="what-would-you-say-is-your-biggest-strength-in-regards-to-your-position-your-biggest-weakness" class="align-center">What would you say is your biggest strength in regards to your position? Your biggest weakness?</h5><p>I’d say my biggest strength is my commitment to consistency and reliability. I’ve been present for every vote, engaged in every debate, and worked tirelessly to ensure that the legislation I support reflects both practical solutions and idealistic values.<br><br>For a weakness, it would be my tendency to take on too much personally. I like to have a hand in drafting, refining, and debating legislation, which sometimes makes delegation harder for me. While I’m learning to trust others more in collaborative efforts, I still struggle with balancing my workload and ensuring that I’m not stretched too thin. But I’d argue that this comes from a place of care—I want to give everything I can to this position.</p><h5 id="in-25-words-or-less-what-would-you-say-to-convince-an-undecided-voter-to-support-your-campaign" class="align-center">In 25 words or less, what would you say to convince an undecided voter to support your campaign?</h5><p>I'm a steady hand for meaningful reform. I’ve shown up, delivered results, and fought for transparency, accountability, and progress. Together, we can shape SimDem’s future.</p><hr class="separator separator--long-line"><div><h4>Share article:</h4><center><button onclick="copyURL()">Copy link</button><script>function copyURL() {
